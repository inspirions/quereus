# Sync Module - Multi-Master CRDT Replication

> **Stability: Experimental** — see [Stability Tiers](stability.md#tiers).

The architecture of `quereus-sync`, a fully automatic multi-master CRDT replication system for Quereus. It enables offline-first applications where multiple replicas independently modify data and converge to a consistent state.

## Design Goals

- **Fully Automatic**: every table in the store is CRDT-enabled; no opt-in.
- **Automatic Schema Evolution**: schema changes are tracked and synchronized without special handling.
- **Transport Agnostic**: exposes sync data structures and APIs, assuming no transport layer.
- **Backend Agnostic**: LevelDB (Node.js) and IndexedDB (browser), via the store plugin.
- **Reactive**: hooks for UI reactivity on local or remote data changes.
- **Transaction-Aware**: changes are grouped by transaction for atomic sync operations.

## Architecture Overview

Three layers:

- **Application** — the Quereus `Database`, the reactive sync hooks, and a user-provided
  transport (WebSocket / HTTP / WebRTC / …).
- **`quereus-sync`** — the HLC clock, the metadata store, the sync protocol and the schema
  tracker, wrapped by `SyncModule`, which intercepts mutations, records CRDT metadata, and
  delegates to the layer below.
- **`quereus-store`** — LevelDB (Node.js) or IndexedDB (browser), holding data *and* CRDT
  metadata in one backend.

## Core Concepts

### Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC)

A Hybrid Logical Clock establishes causal ordering of events across distributed replicas, combining:

- **Physical Time**: Wall clock time in milliseconds for rough ordering
- **Logical Counter**: Disambiguates events within the same millisecond
- **Site ID**: 16-byte UUID identifying each replica
- **opSeq**: Per-transaction sub-order disambiguating facts of the *same* transaction

```typescript
interface HLC {
  wallTime: bigint;      // Physical time (ms since epoch)
  counter: number;       // Logical counter (0-65535)
  siteId: Uint8Array;    // 16-byte replica UUID
  opSeq: number;         // Per-transaction sub-order (0-based uint32)
}
```

HLC ordering: `(wallTime, counter, siteId, opSeq)` compared lexicographically. Higher wall
time is newer; equal wall times order by counter; ties break deterministically by site ID;
and facts of the *same* transaction (same `wallTime`, `counter`, `siteId`) order by `opSeq`.

`opSeq` is the data-model layer for "HLC = transaction" grouping: a contiguous,
0-based sub-order assigned per transaction. Because `siteId` is compared **before**
`opSeq`, two different sites never reach the `opSeq` tiebreak, so `opSeq` only ever
discriminates facts produced by one site at one `(wallTime, counter)` — i.e. within a
single transaction. It is **transaction-local**: it resets every transaction and is
**not** persisted in the `hc:` clock state.

Encoding widths: the comparison key serializes as 30 bytes —
8 (`wallTime`) + 2 (`counter`) + 16 (`siteId`) + 4 (`opSeq`, big-endian uint32) —
both for storage (`serializeHLC`) and as the sortable change-log key component
(`serializeHLCForKey`), where the `opSeq` bytes sit after `siteId` so lexicographic
key order matches `compareHLC`.

**Clock-drift bound — rejected pre-commit.** A remote HLC whose `wallTime` exceeds
the local wall time by more than `MAX_DRIFT_MS` (60 s) is rejected: a peer with a
badly-wrong clock would otherwise land far-future LWW winners that permanently beat
every legitimate future write. The check (`assertWithinDrift` in `clock/hlc.ts`) is a
side-effect-free bound shared by the apply paths and `HLCManager.receive`, and runs as
**pre-commit validation** — the wire path on the batch's maximum fact HLC at the top of
`applyChanges`, the snapshot path on the header HLC before `clearExistingMetadata`,
both **before any data or CRDT metadata is written**. A rejected drifted batch/snapshot
therefore lands **nothing** (the receiver's existing metadata is not even cleared);
`receive`'s own late check is a last-line defense.

### Conflict Resolution: Column-Level Last-Write-Wins (LWW)

Each column of each row is tracked independently; when the same column is modified on multiple replicas, the highest-HLC write wins.

```
Replica A: UPDATE users SET name = 'Alice' WHERE id = 1  @ HLC(1000, 1, A)
Replica B: UPDATE users SET email = 'b@x.com' WHERE id = 1  @ HLC(1000, 2, B)

After merge: Row has name='Alice' (from A) AND email='b@x.com' (from B)
```

This is more fine-grained than row-level LWW, preserving more user intent.

#### Pluggable Conflict Resolution

Setting `conflictResolver` on `SyncConfig` replaces the default LWW strategy. The resolver is called for every column-level conflict where a local version already exists.

```typescript
import { createSyncModule, localWinsResolver, remoteWinsResolver } from '@quereus/sync';
import type { ConflictResolver } from '@quereus/sync';

// Custom: per-column policy. Built-ins: localWinsResolver (target-wins),
// remoteWinsResolver (source-wins).
const resolver: ConflictResolver = (ctx) => {
  if (ctx.column === 'counter') return 'remote';  // max-wins simulation
  return 'local';                                  // default: keep local
};
const { syncManager } = await createSyncModule(kv, storeEvents, {
  conflictResolver: resolver,
});
```

When no `conflictResolver` is configured, the fast-path HLC comparison is used directly (no extra KV read per column). Schema conflicts remain non-pluggable.

The `ctx` (`ConflictContext`) also carries the incoming change's optional before-image as
`ctx.remotePriorValue` / `ctx.remotePriorHlc` — the value (and its HLC) the remote write
overwrote at its origin (see § Data Structures → per-cell before-image) — so a resolver or
transition validator can see what the source changed *from* (e.g. accept the remote only if
it transitioned from the value the receiver still holds). Both are absent when the incoming
change carried no prior, and neither affects default resolution.

> **Future Work**: The architecture supports extending to other CRDT types (counters, sets, RGA for text) by tracking different metadata per column type.

### Tombstones and Deletions

Deletions are recorded as "tombstones" with an HLC timestamp, preventing deleted rows from being resurrected by older writes arriving later.

**Resurrection Policy** (configurable):
- **Default: Delete Wins** (`allowResurrection: false`) - once a row is tombstoned, **all** subsequent column writes for it are blocked — regardless of the write's HLC — until the tombstone is pruned at the retention horizon
- **Optional: Resurrection Allowed** (`allowResurrection: true`) - an insert/update with HLC > the tombstone's T1 resurrects the row; writes with HLC ≤ T1 stay blocked

**The rule applies within one apply batch too**: a delete carried in an `applyChanges` batch blocks that same batch's column changes for its row exactly as an already-stored tombstone would (the row's max-HLC in-batch delete is the blocker; under `allowResurrection` a column change with a later HLC survives it). One batch therefore leaves the same **state** as the same changes applied across separate batches, and re-emits identical changes onward. The *event stream* is not identical: `onConflictResolved` fires before the in-batch reconciliation runs, so a change that ends up blocked can still have emitted one, and a delete + re-creation collapses to a single net store event rather than a delete followed by an insert.

**`applyChanges` is order-independent.** A batch may arrive in any order and produces the same committed state as the HLC-ordered array. This is a contract callers can rely on rather than re-derive: `getChangesSince` returns HLC-ordered transactions, but `applyChanges` takes whatever array its caller hands it — the coordinator's `onBeforeApplyChanges` approval hook returns a caller-supplied array, the REST/WebSocket ingress accepts an arbitrary array from any client, and a caller merging two senders' changesets produces an interleaving neither sender emitted. Resolution and the in-batch delete reconciliation already decide by HLC; the three lists that reach the store as plain arrays are sorted by HLC in `change-applicator.ts` before they leave it — the data ops (`orderDataChangesByHLC`), the DDL (`orderMigrationsByHLC`), and the `onRemoteChange` payload. Without that, the two layers answer "which write survives" by two different rules: the store adapter replays each row group in **list** order (`DataChangeToApply` carries no timestamp), so a reordered batch could delete a row from the table while the metadata recorded it as resurrected — leaving the replica advertising a row it does not have. Everything else in an apply (the `ApplyResult` counters, quarantine holds, the clock watermark max) is order-insensitive by construction. The guarantee covers committed **state**, not the event stream: `onConflictResolved` fires in arrival order, and an `onUnknownTable` event names the first changeset that referenced the table as the straggler origin, so a reordered batch can attribute it to a different relayer — telemetry only, never a stored fact.

**A primary-key change tombstones the old identity.** Sync sees the engine's data events, and
those split a key change that *moves* a row into a `delete` at the old key followed by an
`insert` at the new one ([usage § Subscribing to Data Changes](usage.md#subscribing-to-data-changes)).
So `update t set id = 2 where id = 1` records a tombstone at `pk [1]` and a full cell set — every
column, not just `id` — at `pk [2]`. That is what stops the receiving peer from ending up holding
both rows, and it means a table that re-keys rows routinely accrues tombstones at the same rate,
each held to the TTL below. A key rewrite that does *not* move the row (a case-only change under
a `NOCASE` key) stays one update and tombstones nothing.

**Tombstone TTL**: retained for a configurable duration (default 30 days); sync attempts after expiry should fall back to full snapshot transfer.

**Tombstones travel in snapshots**, on **both** paths, so a fresh replica ends with the sender's tombstones — a row deleted before the snapshot stays deleted, and a later stale write for it stays tombstone-blocked. The streaming path (`getSnapshotStream` / `applySnapshotStream`) carries them as a global `tombstone`-chunk pass; the non-streaming path as `Snapshot.tombstones: SnapshotTombstone[]`, filled from a global tombstone scan and re-written after the metadata clear. Both forms are **global**, not nested under `TableSnapshot`, so a fully-deleted row with no live column-versions still travels. Caveat on both: `createdAt` is re-based to bootstrap time on the receiver, so a bootstrapped tombstone lives a full TTL horizon from the bootstrap, not from the original deletion.

### Unknown-Table Disposition

After a basis table retires everywhere (see [migration.md § Contract](migration.md#4-contract--retire-the-old-table)), a long-offline **straggler** can reconnect and send changes for a table the receiver no longer has. The receiver detects this **structurally** in Phase 1 of `applyChanges` — the table simply isn't in the local basis (`getTableSchema` returns nothing); there is no version negotiation. Detection unions the current basis with the batch's own in-flight DDL, so a `create_table` earlier in the same batch makes its table known, a `drop_table` makes one unknown, and a `rename_table` does both at once (its new name known, its old name unknown). The self-origin echo skip runs first, so a peer never quarantines its own change.

Diverted changes are **never resolved, applied, or recorded as CRDT metadata** — that keeps the change log clean for a table the receiver does not have — and are handled per `SyncConfig.unknownTableDisposition`:

| Disposition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `quarantine` (default) | Durably hold each diverted `Change` verbatim under a `qt:` key, HLC-keyed (one entry per change, so re-apply is idempotent), committed inside the same admission unit as the data/metadata so a crash cannot strand a straggler's write. Inspect with `QuarantineStore.list`; GC at the retention horizon via `pruneQuarantine()` (the same `now - receivedAt > retentionHorizonMs` test tombstones use). |
| `ignore` | Drop the diverted changes (nothing durable written). The deliberate opt-out — write loss is intentional and observable, not silent. |
| `store-and-forward` | Hold each diverted `Change` exactly as `quarantine` does **and** mark it *forwardable*, so this peer relays it to peers that still have the table via the existing outbound delta sync (see § Store-and-forward relay). Inspect forwardable holds with `QuarantineStore.listForwardable`. |

**Telemetry fires either way**, because the failure mode the disposition guards against is otherwise silent write loss the straggler never learns about:

- `onUnknownTable(listener)` — one `UnknownTableEvent` per distinct unknown table per apply (see § Reactive Hooks).
- `getUnknownTableStats()` — cumulative, observe-only: `{ ignored, quarantined, forwarded, relayed, byTable }` (diverted-change counts by disposition and by `schema.table`). `forwarded` counts changes held forwardable at apply time (held once); `relayed` counts forwardable changes re-offered through `getChangesSince` — one held entry may relay many times until it GCs.
- `ApplyResult.unknownTable` — count of changes diverted this apply, for callers that don't subscribe.

When `getTableSchema` is absent (e.g. a relay-only coordinator with no basis oracle) detection is **inert**, and the store adapter's defensive `Table not found for external write` throw remains the fallback. Snapshot bootstrap paths (`applySnapshot` / `applySnapshotStream`) are out of scope — they transfer a whole basis, not a straggler delta, so an unknown table there still hits that defensive throw.

#### Store-and-forward relay

This peer re-offers its forwardable holds to peers that still have the table, riding the existing outbound delta path: `getChangesSince` folds `QuarantineStore.listForwardable()` into its merged `ChangeSet[]` return — **no new transport surface**, so `quereus-sync-client` / `sync-coordinator` need no change. Each forwarded change keeps its **original `hlc` + `siteId`** (the straggler's fact), which makes the relay convergent and loop-free with **no per-table peer-membership oracle** (none exists):

- **Watermark-safe.** Forwardable changes are filtered `HLC > sinceHLC` before merge, like change-log changes. A consumer advances its per-peer `lastSyncHLC` to `max(ChangeSet.hlc)`; without the filter, a forwarded-only round carrying an old HLC would regress that watermark and trigger a re-scan/re-deliver flood.
- **Loop-free.** A receiver that still lacks the table re-disposes the forwarded change per its own config (re-quarantine / re-forward). Because HLC + siteId are preserved, a peer that already holds it re-holds it idempotently (one HLC-keyed entry), and the per-peer watermark stops re-send after one exchange — so two non-holders ping-ponging a change quiesce instead of looping.
- **Bound + ordering.** The change-log scan early-exits at a transaction cut `C`; the forwardable scan is full (all `> sinceHLC`); `buildTransactionChangeSets` re-bounds the union at `batchSize` at a transaction boundary `M ≤ C`. Everything `≤ M` from both sources is present, so the returned prefix stays contiguous and a forwarded change interleaves with change-log changes in global HLC order; entries beyond `M` are re-collected next round. A forwarded change re-forms the straggler's original transaction by `deterministicTxnId`, so a straggler transaction touching both a live and a now-retired-here table rejoins into one ChangeSet.
- **Accepted limitation.** A straggler change causally older than the holder's sync recency with a peer (`HLC ≤ sinceHLC`) is not relayed via this delta path — the same scalar-watermark limitation the base delta layer has (such a change arrives by direct sync / snapshot instead). store-and-forward targets the transitional uneven-retirement window where the straggler's writes are recent enough to exceed holder watermarks; quarantine prevents write loss outside it.
- **Snapshot carve-out.** Forwardable entries are **delta-only**: a snapshot transfers the offering peer's own basis, and a forwarded change is for a table that peer does not have. The snapshot collectors scan only `cv:` / `tb:` / `sm:`, never `qt:`.
- **GC vs in-flight relay.** A forwardable entry pruned at the horizon while a slow peer still needed it is acceptable — that peer was already past the delivery guarantee. After `pruneQuarantine` removes it, `getChangesSince` no longer relays it.

#### Revival / drain

A retired table can come **back** — re-created app-side, a `create_table` arriving in an inbound batch, or a local lens redeploy re-mapping it into the basis. Its held changes (both `quarantine` and forwardable `store-and-forward`; a held change is a held change regardless of *why*) are then **replayed into the now-present table** rather than waiting on horizon GC, via `SyncManager.drainHeldChanges(schema?, table?)` — a sibling of `pruneTombstones` / `pruneQuarantine` / `evictExpiredBasisTables`, called from the host's maintenance path. The library adds **no timer**; it *also* drains **reactively** on the two library-internal reappearance paths (*Low-latency reappearance* below), and the **host** can drive an equally eager drain on an app-side local `create table` (*Who drives the sweep* below).

- **Scope** mirrors `QuarantineStore.list`: `(schema, table)` drains one table, `(schema)` a schema, the no-arg form every held entry whose table is back. Returns the number of held entries cleared.
- **Resolution** runs each held change against the reappeared table exactly like a fresh inbound change (LWW / tombstone-blocking / `allowResurrection`), then **clears it from the hold whether or not it applied** — one that lost LWW or was tombstone-blocked resolves identically on any later sweep, so holding it longer is pointless; only entries for still-absent tables stay held. A held column change for a column the re-created table no longer has is **drift-dropped** (resolved-and-cleared, never sent to the store), so one stale entry cannot poison the table's whole drain admission.
- **Ordering — never interleaved.** Drain always runs as a *separate* apply unit, **after** the re-creating batch or deploy has committed, so the fresh data lands first and the older held changes LWW-resolve against it — no intra-admission interleaving, no re-merge of the already-merged HLC watermark. The whole call is one `admitGroup` unit (data first → CRDT metadata + held-entry deletes second), so a crash before the metadata commit leaves the entries held and a re-drain re-resolves them idempotently.
- **Events.** Applied changes fire `onRemoteChange` (so MV maintenance / `Database.watch` / UI react to the revival), grouped by each held change's **original origin** `hlc.siteId`; each drained table fires `onHeldChangesDrained` (`{ schema, table, drained, applied, skipped }`, `applied + skipped === drained`). A forwarded entry that drains stops being relay-offered and rides the normal change log thereafter.
- **No-oracle no-op.** Without `getTableSchema` a relay-only coordinator cannot tell which held tables are present, so `drainHeldChanges` returns 0 and touches nothing — as unknown-table detection is inert there. Zero-cost when nothing is held.
- **Low-latency reappearance.** Both library-internal paths replay the held edits the moment the revival commits, rather than waiting up to one sweep interval. Both share `SyncConfig.drainOnReappear` (default **on**; `false` leaves all drain timing to the host sweep), are **advisory** (a drain throw is logged + swallowed — the revival is already committed, so held entries stay held for the next sweep), **idempotent** with the periodic sweep (a second drain of an already-drained table returns 0), and inert on a relay-only / no-oracle peer.
  - **Inbound `create_table` / `rename_table`.** When a remote peer re-creates the table mid-sync — or renames a table *onto* the held name, which makes that name exist just the same — `applyChanges` runs the drain after the admitting batch commits. Only an *applied* migration triggers it — an HLC-dominated duplicate does not — and a batch whose schema steps leave the name absent (a trailing `drop_table`, or a later rename away) is a no-op. No exec mutex is held here, so this drain is awaited inline.
  - **Lens redeploy.** When a local `apply schema` redeploy re-maps a basis table from `detached` back into the basis, `recordLensDeployment` runs the drain after its lifecycle records are durable and their `onBasisTableLifecycle` events have fired (so the basis oracle sees the re-attached table). Only the precise `detached → present` transition triggers it; an idempotent re-deploy and a brand-new table both skip the scoped scan, and the oracle gate makes any over-trigger a harmless no-op. The drain cannot abort the deploy. **Re-entrancy:** the `notifyLensDeployment` hook is awaited *inside* the firing `apply schema` statement, which holds the engine exec mutex, and the drain re-enters the engine via `db.ingestExternalRowChanges`, which acquires that same mutex — awaiting it inline would deadlock. So when the engine reports it is mid-statement (`Database._isExecuting()`), the drain is **deferred to fire-and-forget**: it queues on the mutex and runs the instant `apply schema` releases it, making the reappearance *eventually*-immediate rather than awaited by the deploy. Outside a live statement (e.g. a metadata-only unit test over a stub store) it still awaits inline.

**Who drives the sweep.** The library schedules nothing; the host owns cadence. It does ship the *shape* of one pass — sweep order, per-sweep error isolation, the single-flight guard — as `runSyncMaintenancePass` / `createSyncMaintenanceTicker` (`src/sync/maintenance.ts`), so every host runs the same semantics instead of re-deriving them; arming a timer around that is still the host's job.

The **quoomb-web worker** runs all five sweeps on one periodic loop (5-minute default cadence, plus an immediate pass at sync-module init), owned by the sync module: started on init, stopped on `close()`, surviving `disconnectSync()` so held changes drain even while offline. It also subscribes `db.onSchemaChange` and fires an **immediate** scoped `drainHeldChanges(schema, table)` when the app **locally** re-creates a table — a `{type:'create', objectType:'table', remote:false}` event, emitted post-commit so the table is durable when the listener runs. That listener is fire-and-forget (a throw is logged, never re-thrown into the user's `create table`) and **not** gated by `drainOnReappear`, which governs only the two library-internal paths. Remote `create_table` is excluded (already drained reactively); `alter`/`drop` and `index`/`column` events never revive a held table and are filtered out.

The relay-only **`sync-coordinator`** runs the same pass on its own loop (`src/service/maintenance.ts`), started in `CoordinatorService.initialize()` and stopped in `shutdown()`, differing in three ways because it is a multi-tenant relay:

- **Cadence is hourly, not 5-minutely**, because two sweeps are inert on a relay and return 0 — `drainHeldChanges` (no `getTableSchema` oracle) and `evictExpiredBasisTables` (no `dropLocalTable` reclaim callback) — and the drain is the only latency-sensitive one. `pruneTombstones`, `pruneQuarantine` and `repairChangeLog` all do real work here (none of the three depends on a basis oracle or a reclaim callback) and act at horizon granularity or on the whole change log, so hourly is ample. The inert two are still called, for symmetry and because they cost nothing.
- **One pass sweeps every open database**, iterating the `StoreManager`'s open set and pinning each store by refcount for its sweep so a concurrent idle-close cannot pull the LevelDB handle out from under a scan. A store closed between the pass snapshotting the open set and reaching it is skipped. Failures are isolated per sweep *and* per store, so one bad tenant cannot starve the rest.
- **Only already-open databases are swept**; one closed on disk waits until a client next opens it. An eager scan of every database directory was rejected: it would open — and, where disk eviction is enabled, re-download from S3 — databases nobody is using, turning a cheap housekeeping tick into an unbounded I/O storm.

### Transaction-Based Change Grouping

Changes are grouped by transaction: all changes within a transaction are sent as a unit and applied atomically, preserving referential integrity across related writes.

**The grouping boundary is the engine, not the store.** The authoritative
"one logical transaction = one group" anchor is the engine's `DatabaseEventEmitter`
(`packages/quereus/src/core/database-events.ts`), which hooks every module's event
emitter and **batches all data and schema events of the whole logical transaction** —
`startBatch()` at `beginTransaction`, `flushBatch()` at `commitTransaction`,
`discardBatch()` at `rollbackTransaction` (`database-transaction.ts`), with savepoint
layers discarded on `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`. At the commit flush point the complete,
ordered, multi-table fact set of one transaction is known, so it is exposed as a single
grouped delivery:

```typescript
interface TransactionCommitBatch {
  readonly dataEvents: ReadonlyArray<DatabaseDataChangeEvent>;   // flush order
  readonly schemaEvents: ReadonlyArray<DatabaseSchemaChangeEvent>;
}

// Fires once per committed transaction (across all tables); dropped on rollback;
// never fires for a transaction that produced no data/schema events.
const off = db.onTransactionCommit((batch) => { /* assign one HLC to the group */ });
```

This is the boundary the sync layer anchors an HLC to: one `onTransactionCommit`
batch ⇒ one transaction ⇒ one HLC. It is purely additive — the per-event
`onDataChange` / `onSchemaChange` channels are untouched.

**Why not the store coordinator.** The store has one `TransactionCoordinator` *per
module* (`store-module-base.ts` `getCoordinator()`), shared by every table. A **cross-module**
transaction (e.g. a store source plus a memory source, or two durable modules) spans
several coordinators/emitters, each firing its own event burst, so a per-coordinator
commit would split one logical transaction into multiple groups and assign it multiple
HLCs, breaking the referential-integrity property above. Only the engine emitter sees the
whole transaction at once.

Ordering within a batch is the engine flush order: base batch then each savepoint layer
in push order — i.e. per-module/per-table arrival order at commit, not global
DML-interleave order (store coordinators buffer per-table and fire at their own commit).
This is deterministic and replayable, which is what downstream `opSeq` assignment needs.

#### Write side: one tick per commit, `opSeq` per fact

The sync layer's local-change capture (`SyncManagerImpl.handleTransactionCommit`)
consumes that grouped batch and records the whole transaction under **one** base HLC:

```
onTransactionCommit(batch):
  localSchema = batch.schemaEvents where !remote
  localData   = batch.dataEvents   where !remote and its table is still in the basis
  if both empty: return                 // all-remote echo, or empty/idle commit
  base  = hlcManager.tick()             // ONE tick per transaction; opSeq 0
  txnId = deterministicTxnId(base)      // stable over (wallTime, counter, siteId)
  opSeq = 0; kvBatch = kv.batch()
  for each local schema event (DDL before DML):
     record migration with hlc = {...base, opSeq: opSeq++}
  for each local data event, for each fact (per changed column, or the deletion):
     record column-version / tombstone + change-log entry, hlc = {...base, opSeq: opSeq++}
  persist HLC clock state (wallTime/counter only) into kvBatch
  kvBatch.write()                       // all metadata for the transaction, atomically
  emit ONE local-change event { transactionId: txnId, changes, pendingSync: true }
```

Why one tick is correct: `tick()` advances `wallTime`/`counter` once, so the base
`(wallTime, counter, siteId)` is unique among this site's transactions. Every fact
of the transaction shares that triple and differs only in `opSeq` — exactly the
identity the read side groups on. DDL events take the lowest `opSeq`s so they sort
below the same transaction's DML ([sync-schema.md](sync-schema.md) § DDL Application Order).

**Local capture is best-effort at TABLE granularity.** A table out of basis at capture
time — the schema oracle no longer knows it, typically because this same transaction
dropped it — has no sound pk identity, so it costs its own rows; the transaction's other
tables and all its schema migrations still record. The filter
(`filterCapturableDataEvents`) runs *before* the tick, so a fully-skipped transaction
consumes no HLC and nothing is half-staged into the shared KV batch. Each skipped table
is logged once with its change count — informationally when this transaction dropped it,
as a warning otherwise. The gate is basis membership, not "this transaction dropped the
table": `drop t; create t; insert into t` leaves `t` in basis and is captured in full.
Only the unknown-table case is skipped; any other keying failure still fails the
transaction loudly. A relay-only manager (no schema oracle) reports every table in basis,
so nothing is skipped there.

**Commit recording is serialized.** `handleTransactionCommit` does async dedup reads (the
prior column-version / tombstone lookups that delete a superseded change-log entry) before
its single `kvBatch.write()`. Two rapid commits must not interleave at those awaits, or
commit N+1's dedup would read pre-N-write state, miss the prior version, and leave a stale
change-log entry — breaking the *at most one surviving entry per key* invariant the read
side relies on. `SyncManagerImpl` therefore chains each commit onto a tail promise
(`enqueueTransactionCommit`). The tick itself is synchronous and already ordered; only the
post-tick dedup reads need this.

**Local capture reads its own writes.** Within one transaction, every metadata read (the
dedup lookups and the delete cleanup's column set) consults a per-transaction
staged-metadata overlay (`staged-transaction-metadata.ts`) *before* committed storage,
because the transaction's own writes are still pending in its single `kvBatch`. A
transaction that touches one row more than once — update then update, insert then delete,
delete then reinsert then delete — therefore records exactly the metadata the equivalent
separate transactions would: the later event sees the earlier one's staged cell versions
and tombstone, dedupes the right change-log entry, chains the right before-image, and the
delete cleanup removes staged cells as well as committed ones. The cleanup stages its
removals into the same `kvBatch` (whose later-op-wins ordering resolves put-then-delete
and delete-then-put per key), which also completes the pseudocode's atomicity claim:
*all* of a transaction's metadata lands in one atomic batch.

`opSeq` ordering semantics: **intra-table** order is true write order (a coordinator
buffers its table's events in DML order); **cross-table** order is the deterministic
per-coordinator commit order, not the global DML interleave. That suffices for
intra-transaction atomicity, intra-table parent-before-child, and full determinism
(same facts ⇒ same `opSeq` on every peer), and is **not** an apply-correctness hazard:
the apply path re-validates no declared constraint (child-side FK existence included —
see § Transactional Integrity During Sync → *Apply-time validation*), so a child fact
landing before its parent cannot trip one. It matters only to the opt-in parent-side
FK *actions* path.

Edge cases:
- **Rollback / discard** — the engine fires no group, so `tick()` is never called and no
  HLC/`opSeq` is consumed; a discarded transaction never pollutes a later one's ordering.
- **All-remote group (echo)** — a pure sync-apply transaction (every event
  `remote: true`) is skipped entirely; its metadata was already recorded on apply.
- **Mixed group** — local + remote in one transaction records only the local facts,
  assigning `opSeq` only to recorded facts so they stay contiguous.
- **`opSeq` exhaustion** — `opSeq` is a uint32; a transaction whose fact count would
  exceed `MAX_OPSEQ` throws a `QuereusError` (telemetered as an error sync-state)
  rather than wrapping. Practically unreachable.

#### Deterministic transaction id

`transactionId` is derived from the base HLC —
`deterministicTxnId(base) = "${wallTime}:${counter}:${base64(siteId)}"` — rather than
a random UUID. Same transaction ⇒ same id on every peer (the read side reproduces it
from the change-log facts' shared base), so no separate `tx:` record is persisted.

#### Read side: one ChangeSet per transaction

`getChangesSince(peerSiteId, sinceHLC?)` returns **one `ChangeSet` per source
transaction** — never splitting a commit, never merging two
(`change-grouping.ts` `buildTransactionChangeSets`):

```
getChangesSince(peerSiteId, sinceHLC):
  facts      = sinceHLC ? changeLog.scan(after sinceHLC) : (all column-versions + tombstones)
               skipping any fact whose hlc.siteId == peerSiteId   // echo filter (whole tx)
  migrations = sm: scan, after sinceHLC, not from peerSiteId
  group facts+migrations by transaction identity (wallTime, counter, siteId):
    each group ⇒ one ChangeSet:
      changes:          group's facts in opSeq order (intra-table write order)
      schemaMigrations: group's migrations in opSeq order (DDL below the tx's DML)
      hlc:              group's MAX fact HLC (last opSeq) — the commit boundary
      transactionId:    deterministicTxnId(base)          — same derivation as write side
      siteId:           the group's origin site
  order ChangeSets by base HLC ascending
  bound by batchSize at TRANSACTION granularity (below)
```

The HLC scan is already ordered by `(wallTime, counter, siteId, opSeq)` (the
change-log key), so a transaction's facts are contiguous and in `opSeq` order.

- **Echo filter** — facts/migrations whose `hlc.siteId == peerSiteId` are excluded.
  Because a transaction is wholly one site's, this drops *whole* transactions — never
  a half-empty ChangeSet.
- **DDL-only transaction** — a `create table` with no DML forms its own ChangeSet
  (`changes: []`, one migration), `hlc` = the migration HLC.
- **DDL + DML in one transaction** — migration and data share the base, so they land
  in one ChangeSet; the migration's lower `opSeq` keeps DDL ahead of DML (the
  applicator processes `schemaMigrations` first regardless).

**Transaction-granularity bounding.** `batchSize` caps the response by accumulating
**whole** transactions: once a completed transaction pushes the cumulative `changes`
count `>= batchSize`, extraction stops and returns — the rest come on the next
`getChangesSince` call. A transaction is **never** split to hit the bound.

The bound applies at **scan time**, not just response time: on the delta path the
change-log scan is HLC-ordered, so `collectChangesSince` detects each transaction
boundary and stops scanning the moment enough whole transactions accumulate. Two scans
are *not* bounded this way — the from-zero full scan (`collectAllChanges`, used when
`sinceHLC` is absent) reads `cv:`/`tb:` keyed by table/pk rather than HLC, so it cannot
early-exit (a large initial range is served by a snapshot instead); and the `sm:`
schema-migration scan is not HLC-ordered, so it is drained in full (migrations are few,
and grouping drops any that sort past the bounded fact watermark — over-scan costs work,
never correctness).

Scan-time boundary detection keys off the *log entry's* HLC while grouping keys off the
*resolved version's* HLC; the two agree because **at most one change-log entry survives
per key**, with HLC equal to the current version. Three mechanisms keep that true:
**overwrite dedup** across separate writes/applies (a newer value dedupes the prior
column entry, a newer tombstone the prior delete entry — so a `delete → reinsert →
delete` key reuse leaves no stale delete entry to re-attribute to the later tombstone's
HLC and split that transaction across rounds); the **staged-metadata overlay** for
repeats within one local transaction (§ Write side → *Local capture reads its own
writes*); and **in-batch collapse** on apply (`commitChangeMetadata`), where two versions
of one key in a single `applyChanges` call resolve against the same pre-batch prior
version, so only the max-HLC winner per key is written (e.g. concurrent deletes of the
same pk relayed together). Those in-memory collapse keys are built with the same
length-prefixed join as the stored keys (§ *Storage layout*) — punctuation-joining
`(schema, table, identity)` would let rows of two differently-named tables collapse onto
one winner and leave the loser in the store with no bookkeeping at all.

**Entries die with their target.** The change log is a *derived index* over the live
`cv:`/`tb:` records — `resolveLogEntry` returns `null` for an entry whose record is
gone — so every entry is deleted in the same `WriteBatch` as the record it points at:
a row's `column` entries with its column versions on delete
(`deleteRowVersionsAndLogEntries`, called from the local write path `recordDataEvent`
and from apply's `commitChangeMetadata`), and a pk's `delete` entry with its expired
tombstone (`SyncManagerImpl.pruneTombstones`). This bounds the change log to **live
cells + live tombstones** rather than to the replica's lifetime delete volume, and is
lossless by construction — a dropped entry already resolved to `null` and could never
have appeared in any `ChangeSet`.

Pruning entries by a *time* horizon (`ChangeLogStore.pruneEntriesBefore`) is a different,
deliberately **unwired** operation: it drops entries for still-live cells, safe only once
the server refuses delta sync for a too-old `sinceHLC` (`SyncManager.canDeltaSync`,
likewise not yet called by the coordinator).

**Repairing pre-existing orphans.** The forward cleanup above only stops *new* orphans —
each deletes a `cl:` entry *via* the record it points at, so an entry whose record died
before the cleanup existed can never be reached that way. `SyncManager.repairChangeLog()`
reaches those instead: a full scan of the change log that deletes every entry
`resolveLogEntry` resolves to `null`. It is a sibling of `pruneTombstones` in the host
maintenance pass (`SyncMaintenanceTarget`, `src/sync/maintenance.ts`) — safe to run at any
time, on any replica, with no peer coordination, since a `null`-resolving entry already
produced no output. Cheap once caught up: a replica with nothing to repair resolves every
entry and deletes none, paying only the scan.

**Oversized transaction.** A transaction whose fact count exceeds `batchSize` is returned
**whole** as one ChangeSet and telemetered (a `console.warn`), never silently chunked —
splitting it would violate the one-ChangeSet-per-transaction contract.

**Watermark halts at transaction boundaries.** Every returned ChangeSet is a whole
transaction whose `hlc` is the commit's max fact HLC, so a consumer setting
`lastSyncHLC = max(applied ChangeSet.hlc)` always lands on a real commit boundary;
`buildChangeLogScanBoundsAfter` then excludes everything `<=` it, so re-fetch resumes
strictly *after* the last whole transaction (no repeats, no gaps, no mid-transaction
resume). A partially applied transaction never advances the watermark: `applyChanges`
applies a ChangeSet atomically and commits metadata only on success (§ Transactional
Integrity During Sync), so a failed ChangeSet leaves the watermark at the prior
boundary.

### Transactional Integrity During Sync

Applying remote changes writes to two separate stores: **CRDT metadata** (column versions, tombstones, peer state) into the sync metadata store, and **table data** into each table's data store. In IndexedDB each table has its own database, so no single atomic transaction can span the metadata store and multiple table stores; LevelDB uses one database with key prefixes and commits an atomic `WriteBatch` across tables.

**Write Order**: crash safety requires **data first**, **metadata second**. A crash before the data write leaves nothing written and re-sync retries; a crash between the two leaves the CRDT state "dirty" so the same changes re-apply on the next sync, safe because CRDT operations are idempotent (same HLC → same LWW outcome); a crash after the metadata write leaves a complete, consistent state. The reverse order is dangerous: crashing after metadata but before data leaves the CRDT state believing the change landed while the data is missing — and re-sync will not retry it.

**Clock-drift rejection is pre-commit validation**, orthogonal to the ordering below (which governs a batch that passed validation): both apply paths check the incoming clock before any data or metadata is written, so a drifted batch/snapshot lands **nothing** (see the HLC section's *Clock-drift bound*).

**Invariant — metadata follows a landed data write**: CRDT metadata must **not** be committed for any change whose data write did not land. This covers two failure shapes, handled identically:
- **Whole-batch throw**: the `applyToStore` callback throws (e.g. the seam commit fails on a connection error or a deferred row constraint). The exception propagates; no metadata is committed. A commit-time **global-assertion** violation is *not* one of these — it is detect-and-notify (below), so it neither throws nor blocks the metadata commit.
- **Per-change failure**: the store adapter does *not* throw on a single change's failure — it keeps applying the other tables (maximizing idempotent storage progress) and records each failure in `ApplyToStoreResult.errors`. The **consumer** treats any non-empty `errors` exactly like a whole-batch throw: it emits `status: 'error'` and throws **before** committing any metadata.

In the **mixed case** — one batch carrying *both* a per-change `errors` failure and a reported global-assertion violation tripped by a successfully-applied change B — `applyDataToStore` emits `onAssertionViolation` **before** the abort throws. B's violating row already committed in report mode (the abort blocks the metadata commit, not the storage write), so the violation is a fact about committed data. On retry B contributes nothing to the seam batch, so the assertion over B's table is not re-evaluated (assertions fire only when their referenced tables changed) and does not double-fire; deferring the emit past the abort would lose it permanently.

**Unified admission core** (`admission.ts`) centralizes both failure shapes and the ordering in one seam, so every ingress modality behaves identically. `applyDataToStore` is the data-first half: it runs `applyToStore`, emits `status: 'error'` and rethrows on a whole-batch throw, then aborts via `throwIfApplyErrors` on any per-change `errors` (the two are mutually exclusive, so the error state is emitted at most once). `admitGroup` wraps it as a group-atomic unit — data, then the caller's `commitMetadata`, then the local HLC clock watermark — used by the wire path (`change-applicator`) and the non-streaming snapshot (`snapshot`). The streaming snapshot (`snapshot-stream`) keeps its checkpoint-based model but reuses `applyDataToStore` per flush, so a flush throw emits the same `status: 'error'` event.

With no metadata committed the caller does not advance its per-peer `lastSyncHLC` watermark, so the **whole batch re-resolves and re-applies on the next sync**, idempotently — value-identical upserts are suppressed by the adapter, so only the previously-failed change is genuinely retried. (A change that *always* fails blocks its batch forever: an accepted "poison batch" property; detection/recovery is the host's.) Selective commit (commit the succeeded subset, skip the failed) is intentionally **not** done — a batch spans multiple HLCs but re-fetch is governed by a single `lastSyncHLC` watermark, which cannot express "all but the failed change", so a skipped change would never be re-sent. The wire batch is therefore **one** all-or-nothing `admitGroup` unit, not one per `ChangeSet`.

**Apply-time validation — trust-the-origin.** The apply path does **not** re-run the
engine's constraint machinery. The production adapter (`createStoreAdapter`, the
`applyToStore` implementation) writes inbound data straight to module storage via
`StoreTable.applyExternalRowChanges` — bypassing the DML executor, so there is **no**
per-row CHECK / NOT NULL / UNIQUE / **child-side FK-existence** check at write time —
then makes a single end-of-invocation seam call, `db.ingestExternalRowChanges`, driving
the post-write pipeline: capture for `Database.watch`, commit-time **global assertions**,
materialized-view maintenance, and *opt-in* parent-side FK actions. The seam re-validates
nothing: the origin enforced every declared constraint at its own commit, and merging
already-consistent facts cannot violate a per-row / child-side constraint that held at
the source.

**Global assertions are detect-and-notify, not block.** A cross-origin *merge* can
produce a global-invariant violation no single origin ever saw — exactly what a
receiver-side global assertion guards. But the merged data must still land: rejecting
would diverge the receiver from the converged truth the network agrees on, so a local
assertion can only usefully *notify*. The adapter drives the incremental seam in **report
mode** (`assertionFailureMode: 'report'`): a violation is **collected and returned**
instead of thrown, and the batch **commits** — the violating row's derived effects (MV
maintenance, `Database.watch` capture) land on the **first** apply, so the MV stays
consistent with the base table, with no divergence and no retry. The consumer surfaces
each violation as an **`onAssertionViolation`** event (see § Reactive Hooks); the host
owns policy. (Snapshot bootstrap does not evaluate assertions at all — it installs one
origin's already-converged state wholesale, so there is no merge to introduce a
violation; see `store-adapter.ts`.)

**Consequence for cross-table ordering.** A child fact carrying a lower `opSeq` than its
parent is harmless: there is no fact-granular FK check to trip. The two facets that *are*
enforced stay order-independent — **global assertions**, the home for referential
invariants the replica itself should enforce and the only form covering self-referential
and cyclic FKs that no topological table sort handles; and **opt-in FK actions**
(`applyForeignKeyActions`, default off), order-independent because the adapter writes
every table's rows to storage *before* the single seam call, so cascade DML re-reads the
fully-merged post-write state.

**Parent-side RESTRICT is not enforced on apply.** The origin already enforced it at its
own commit; re-enforcing it on the receiver would *wedge* the stream (RESTRICT throw →
batch abort → no metadata commit → same batch re-applied → throws again, forever). So the
apply path skips parent-side RESTRICT entirely and propagates only cascade / set-null /
set-default, at **every cascade depth**. This is an **apply-mode RESTRICT suppression**
threaded through the whole DML pipeline: the seam sets a flag for the batch's duration
(mutex held, restored in a `finally`), honored uniformly by the runtime RESTRICT
pre-checks (`runtime/foreign-key-actions.ts`), by every **nested cascade DML** and
**MV-maintenance** FK pass those re-enter, and — crucially — by the **plan-time
parent-side FK check** synthesized into each cascade statement's plan
(`runtime/row-constraints.ts`, the `fk-parent` constraint kind), the primary
enforcer a depth-≥1 cascade would otherwise trip. A replica-only RESTRICT invariant is
**by design not enforced on apply**; express it as a global assertion if the receiver
must be notified.

One exotic limitation no seam-batch ordering fixes: **(F)** a child of two parents with
diverging actions (cascade-delete vs. set-null) whose final state depends on evaluation
order — the seam batch carries no intra-transaction DML order to reconstruct it.
(**(E)**, a child whose two FKs pit one parent's CASCADE against another's RESTRICT, is
moot since RESTRICT never throws on apply; at worst the outcome depends on which cascade
fires first, the same caveat as (F).) Both are handled by keeping `applyForeignKeyActions`
off (the default) or by expressing the referential invariant as a **global assertion**.

Two gaps remain, both addressed below. **Per-table atomicity**: changes *should* be applied through the Store module's `TransactionCoordinator` `WriteBatch`, and the legacy per-table-database `IndexedDBModule` cannot span tables at all. **Isolation**: even with correct write ordering, readers may see partially-applied state during sync, which needs Store-level support.

### Single-Database Architecture (Store Phase 7) ✓

The `UnifiedIndexedDBModule` uses a single IndexedDB database with multiple object stores (one per table), which buys native cross-table IDB transactions — sync metadata and data commit together, with no WAL needed for crash recovery, at the same storage quota. The legacy `IndexedDBModule` has none of that: separate databases per table, sequential commits, and it needs a WAL.

With `UnifiedIndexedDBModule`, sync can use `MultiStoreWriteBatch`:
```typescript
const batch = module.createMultiStoreBatch();
batch.putToStore('main.users', userKey, userData);
batch.putToStore('main.orders', orderKey, orderData);
batch.putToStore('__catalog__', metaKey, syncMetadata);
await batch.write();  // Native atomicity across all stores
```

### Store Isolation (Store Phase 8 - Future)

Store-level transaction isolation (a TransactionLayer/copy-on-write model like the memory vtab's) would let sync stage data and CRDT metadata invisibly and reveal them atomically on commit, closing the isolation gap. Unimplemented; tracked as Phase 8 in store.md and in [`docs/todo.md` § Sync Engine Remaining Work](todo.md#sync-engine-remaining-work).

## Storage Layout

CRDT metadata is stored alongside data in the same KV store using distinct key prefixes:

| Prefix | Purpose | Format |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `cv:⟨schema⟩⟨table⟩⟨pkIdentity⟩⟨col⟩` | Column version | `{hlc, value, pk}` |
| `tb:⟨schema⟩⟨table⟩⟨pkIdentity⟩` | Tombstone | `{hlc, createdAt, pk, priorRow?}` |
| `cl:{hlc}{type}⟨schema⟩⟨table⟩⟨pkIdentity⟩[⟨col⟩]` | HLC-ordered change-log index over `cv:`/`tb:` | *(empty — all info in the key)* |
| `tx:{txId}` | *Reserved — not persisted.* The transaction id is **derived** from the base HLC (see *Deterministic transaction id*); the prefix and `buildTransactionKey` are reserved for a future durable txn log. | — |
| `ps:{siteId}` | Peer sync state (received watermark) | `{lastSyncHlc}` |
| `pt:{siteId}` | Peer sent state (highest HLC pushed to a peer and acked) | `{lastSyncHlc}` |
| `sm:⟨schema⟩⟨kind⟩⟨object⟩{version:010}` | Schema migration (`kind`: `table`\|`index`) | `{ddl, hlc}` |
| `si:` | Site identity | `{siteId, createdAt}` |
| `hc:` | HLC state | `{wallTime, counter}` |
| `fv:` | Sync-metadata format version | decimal string (see *Metadata format version*) |
| `sc:{snapshotId}` | Snapshot checkpoint — resume position of an interrupted streaming apply (see *Checkpoint presence means partial data*) | `{snapshotId, siteId, hlc, completedTables, entriesProcessed, …}` |

`⟨part⟩` above is a **length-prefixed component**: `{len}:{part}`, `len` being the part's
length in string code units (`joinKeyParts`, `metadata/keys.ts`). Schema, table and column
names and pk identities are all arbitrary text — `create table "a:b"` is legal SQL, and a
pk identity freely contains `:` (type tags) and `\0` (member separator) — so no character
can be reserved as a delimiter. Carrying each part's length makes every split exact and
every key prefix unambiguous: a scan over table `a` cannot pick up table `a:b`. The
tradeoff is length-major-then-text sort order rather than alphabetical; per-table and
per-row *contiguity* — the only ordering the streaming snapshot relies on — is unaffected.
Fixed-width components (the 30-byte HLC, the 1-byte change type, `sm:`'s zero-padded
version) carry no prefix.

Co-location buys atomic data+metadata updates within a transaction, one storage backend for both LevelDB and IndexedDB, and no additional database connections.

### Row identity vs. address

Every per-row record splits the primary key into two roles:

- **Identity** — what the record is *filed under* (the pk component of its key).
  Derived by `encodePkIdentity` (`metadata/keys.ts`): each pk column is run
  through its logical type's semantic key transform (TIMESPAN → total seconds,
  so `'PT1H'` ≡ `'PT60M'`) and then its **key collation** normalizer (`'apple'`
  ≡ `'APPLE'` under `collate nocase`), producing the engine's type-tagged
  `serializeKeyNullGrouping` string. That matches how the store and the
  isolation overlay decide "same row?", so one row files under exactly one
  identity no matter which spelling a write used. The encoding is numeric-class
  aware (`5n` and `5` key alike), which also makes bigint pks safe. The identity
  is **lossy and never decoded back**.
- **Address** — what goes on the wire and into record *values* (`ColumnVersion.pk`,
  `Tombstone.pk`): a real, type-valid `SqlValue[]`. Any spelling from the row's
  equivalence class is acceptable; the receiver's store collapses spellings too.

The identity is one of the length-prefixed key components described above, so it needs no
separator to be absent from it. Keying is resolved per
table from its schema (key collations + semantic transforms) via
`metadata/pk-identity.ts`, a thin wrapper over the engine's `resolvePkIdentityKeying`
(`@quereus/quereus`, `util/key-serializer.ts`) — one implementation, shared with the
isolation overlay's row-alignment key, so the layers cannot drift. A wired
`keyNormalizerResolver` (`db.getKeyNormalizerResolver()`) keeps custom collations keying
exactly as the database compares them. A relay-only deployment with no `getTableSchema`
oracle keys raw values — stable for life, since no oracle (hence no identity flip) can
appear later.
Quarantine (`qt:`) keys always use the raw encoding: a quarantined table is out of the
local basis, so no schema exists for it, and its `(hlc, type)` component already makes the
key unique. Snapshot transfers carry **only each entry's raw pk** — no identity travels on
the wire, and the receiver always **derives its own** identity from the pk, exactly as the
delta path does. This is what makes bootstrapping from a differently-keyed sender sound: a
relay-only coordinator keys raw, so it can hold several records for what a schema-holding
receiver considers one row (`'Apple'`/`'APPLE'` under `nocase`); the receiver collapses
them onto its own identity, keeping the greatest-HLC entry per cell (and per tombstone) so
the collapse resolves by last-writer-wins rather than by chunk order. Mid-bootstrap
ordering is guaranteed by the stream itself: all schema migrations precede all table data,
so a table exists by the time its entries need keying.

### Metadata format version

The `fv:` record stores the sync-metadata storage format version
(`SYNC_METADATA_FORMAT_VERSION`, currently **5**: pk-identity keying, raw pk in record
values, every variable-length key component length-prefixed, `sm:` keyed by object kind,
and each `sm:` VALUE carrying a length-prefixed `fromTable` slot between the migration
type and the DDL so a `rename_table` can name the table it renamed. Version 4 ended its
records with the DDL as "rest of buffer", leaving nowhere to append that slot; version 3
lacked the object kind, so a table and a same-named index shared one version counter,
silently suppressing each other's migrations; version 2 also lacked the length
prefixes). `SyncManagerImpl.create` writes it on a fresh replica and refuses to open one
whose stored version is missing (pre-versioning) or different: old keys are unreadable
under the new layout and mixing the two would corrupt both. Recovery is to clear the
replica's sync metadata and re-bootstrap from a peer snapshot — no in-place rewrite pass. Across a mixed 3/4 fleet an index migration is numbered differently at each
end, so it duplicates rather than suppresses; `decideSchemaChange` no-ops the duplicate.

### Snapshot wire-format version

Snapshots carry their own format stamp, separate from the storage format above:
`SNAPSHOT_WIRE_FORMAT_VERSION` (currently **1** — explicit `{column, hlc, value, pk}`
entry records, no identity on the wire), stamped into the streaming header chunk
(`snapshotFormat`) and the non-streaming `Snapshot`. Both apply paths
(`applySnapshotStream`, `applySnapshot`) refuse a snapshot whose stamp is missing or
different **before touching any local state** — the same posture as the `fv:` gate.
The stamp matters because serialized snapshots outlive the sender process: the
coordinator's S3 store (`s3-snapshot-store.ts`) persists serialized chunk arrays at
rest, and an old stored snapshot deserialized by newer code would otherwise silently
mis-parse entry shapes. Recovery is to regenerate the snapshot from a live peer.

Operator note for the coordinator's S3 restore path: the refusal throws out of
`onStoreCreated`, and `StoreManager.openAndRestore` closes the store and rethrows — so a
coordinator holding a stale-format S3 snapshot **cannot open that database at all** until
the stale snapshot objects are removed from the bucket. Delete (or move aside) the
`…/snapshots/` objects for that database; the coordinator then opens empty and
re-accumulates from the clients that reconnect, and the next snapshot it writes carries
the current stamp. Whether an unreadable stored snapshot should instead be logged and
skipped (starting empty, as a missing snapshot already does) is open — see
`tickets/backlog/bug-coordinator-stale-snapshot-blocks-store-open.md`.

## Sync Protocol

Moved to [Sync Protocol](sync-protocol.md#sync-protocol).

## Reactive Hooks

The sync module exposes reactive hooks for UI integration:

```typescript
interface SyncEventEmitter {
  /** Remote changes applied locally */
  onRemoteChange(listener: (event: RemoteChangeEvent) => void): () => void;

  /** Local changes ready to sync */
  onLocalChange(listener: (event: LocalChangeEvent) => void): () => void;

  /** Sync state changed (connected, syncing, error) */
  onSyncStateChange(listener: (state: SyncState) => void): () => void;

  /** A conflict was resolved */
  onConflictResolved(listener: (event: ConflictEvent) => void): () => void;

  /**
   * Inbound changes reference a table outside the local basis (an out-of-basis
   * straggler delta), whatever the disposition. See § Unknown-Table Disposition.
   */
  onUnknownTable(listener: (event: UnknownTableEvent) => void): () => void;

  /**
   * An inbound batch's merged row state tripped a local commit-time global
   * assertion. Detect-and-notify: the data has already converged, so this is
   * informational and the host decides policy. See § Apply-time validation.
   */
  onAssertionViolation(listener: (event: AssertionViolationEvent) => void): () => void;
}

interface RemoteChangeEvent {
  siteId: SiteId;                    // Origin replica
  transactionId: string;
  changes: Change[];
  appliedAt: HLC;
}

interface LocalChangeEvent {
  transactionId: string;
  changes: Change[];
  pendingSync: boolean;              // True if not yet synced to master
}

interface ConflictEvent {
  schema: string;
  table: string;
  pk: SqlValue[];
  column: string;
  localValue: SqlValue;
  remoteValue: SqlValue;
  winner: 'local' | 'remote';
  winningHLC: HLC;
  remotePriorValue?: SqlValue;       // incoming change's before-image (what it overwrote at its origin)
  remotePriorHlc?: HLC;              // HLC of that before-image; present iff remotePriorValue is
}

interface UnknownTableEvent {
  schema: string;
  table: string;
  disposition: 'ignore' | 'quarantine';
  changeCount: number;   // Changes diverted for this table in this apply
  siteId: SiteId;        // Straggler origin (from the changeset)
  latestHLC: HLC;        // Max HLC among the diverted changes
}

interface AssertionViolationEvent {
  assertion: string;     // Name of the violated local assertion
  samples: SqlValue[][]; // Sample rows from the violation query (diagnostic; capped)
}

type SyncState =
  | { status: 'disconnected' }
  | { status: 'connecting' }
  | { status: 'syncing'; progress: number }
  | { status: 'synced'; lastSyncHLC: HLC }
  | { status: 'error'; error: Error };
```

### Integration with Store Events

Local-change capture is sourced from the **engine** transaction boundary, not the
per-table store emitter. `createSyncModule(kv, { transactionSource: db, ... })`
subscribes the SyncManager to `db.onTransactionCommit`; each committed transaction
delivers one grouped batch that the write side records under one HLC (see
§ Transaction-Based Change Grouping → *Write side*). A key design goal is that
reactive events fire **exactly once** for each change, whether local or remote.

> **Why the engine emitter, not the per-table store emitter.** The per-table
> `StoreEventEmitter` / `TransactionCoordinator` sits **below** the transaction
> boundary — each table has its own coordinator, so a cross-table commit fires several
> separate bursts that cannot be grouped into one transaction. The grouped batch
> preserves each event's `remote` flag, so the write side still filters remote-origin
> events out (an all-remote group is a pure sync-apply echo and is skipped). A
> relay-only deployment that produces no local DML simply omits `transactionSource`
> and captures nothing.

#### Event Flow

- **Local**: user SQL → engine commits txn → `db.onTransactionCommit` (grouped, `remote=false`) → SyncManager records metadata under one HLC → UI receives the per-event store events.
- **Remote**: SyncManager applies the change via `applyToStore` → store executes and emits with `remote=true` → SyncManager ignores its own echo → UI receives the event.

Either way the UI receives exactly one event from the Store. The `remote` flag decides whether the SyncManager records CRDT metadata (local) or skips (remote).

#### The `remote` Flag

Both `DataChangeEvent` and `SchemaChangeEvent` include a `remote?: boolean` flag:

```typescript
interface DataChangeEvent {
  type: 'insert' | 'update' | 'delete';
  schemaName: string;
  tableName: string;
  key: SqlValue[];
  oldRow?: Row;
  newRow?: Row;
  remote?: boolean;  // True if from sync or cross-tab
}

interface SchemaChangeEvent {
  type: 'create' | 'alter' | 'drop';
  objectType: 'table' | 'index' | 'view' | 'trigger';
  schemaName: string;
  objectName: string;
  ddl?: string;
  remote?: boolean;  // True if from sync
}
```

`oldRow` / `newRow` are positional, and the sync layer pairs value *i* with column *i* of the
table's schema **as read at event time** (see `recordColumnVersions`). The engine guarantees
that pairing: every event a commit delivers describes its rows in the schema current at
delivery, even when the transaction ran `ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP/RENAME COLUMN` (or a retype /
`SET NOT NULL` backfill) *after* recording the write — the recorded events are rewritten to the
post-ALTER shape before delivery, and `changedColumns` never names a dropped or pre-rename
column. (The store path omits `changedColumns` entirely and the sync layer recomputes the diff
from `oldRow`/`newRow`; an ALTER does not change that.)

#### Sync Module Event Handling

The SyncManager subscribes once to `db.onTransactionCommit`, filters out remote-origin
events, returns early on an all-remote echo, records the whole committed transaction
under one HLC in one `kvBatch` (DDL migrations first, then DML facts, then the persisted
clock state), and emits a single local-change event `{ transactionId, changes,
pendingSync: true }` for UI reactivity. See § Transaction-Based Change Grouping →
*Write side* for the pseudocode.

#### Applying Remote Changes

When the SyncManager applies remote changes, it must execute SQL in a way that the
resulting store events are marked with `remote: true`, so the SyncManager ignores its
own echo. The data write lands first; CRDT metadata is committed only after it succeeds
(see the write-ordering invariant under Transactional Integrity During Sync).

The store plugin provides the mechanism:

```typescript
interface ApplyOptions {
  remote?: boolean;  // Mark resulting events as remote
}

// Store implementation ensures emitted events carry the flag:
//   this.events.emitDataChange({ ...event, remote: options.remote });
```

## Schema Synchronization

How schema (catalog) changes replicate — the CRDT design principles, the `sv:` metadata keys,
"most destructive wins" conflict resolution, DDL-before-DML application order, idempotent DDL
application, and what does and does not replicate — lives in
[sync-schema.md](sync-schema.md). The same doc covers the schema **seed**: shipping an app's
initial schema into each user's database by treating the app provider as a read-only sync
peer.

## Configuration

```typescript
interface SyncConfig {
  /**
   * Retention horizon in milliseconds: changes older than this are not
   * guaranteed deliverable. Bounds tombstone GC, delta-sync eligibility,
   * and retirement timing guidance. Default: 30 days.
   */
  retentionHorizonMs: number;

  /** Whether deleted rows can be resurrected by later writes (default: false) */
  allowResurrection: boolean;

  /** Maximum changes per sync batch (default: 1000) */
  batchSize: number;

  /**
   * What to do with inbound changes that reference a table outside the local
   * basis (an out-of-basis straggler delta — see § Unknown-Table Disposition
   * and migration.md § Contract). Default: `'quarantine'`.
   */
  unknownTableDisposition: 'ignore' | 'quarantine' | 'store-and-forward';

  /**
   * Default policy for reclaiming a *detached* basis table's lingering local
   * storage (see migration.md § 4 Contract). `{ mode: 'horizon' }` (default)
   * evicts once the table has been quiet for `horizonMs` (default
   * `retentionHorizonMs`); `'never'` keeps storage forever; `'immediate'`
   * reclaims on the first sweep after detach. A per-table `quereus.sync.evict`
   * reserved tag overrides this. The sweep, `evictExpiredBasisTables(now?)`, is
   * host-driven (no library timer) and a no-op when no `dropLocalTable` reclaim
   * callback is wired.
   */
  basisEviction?: { mode: 'horizon' | 'never' | 'immediate'; horizonMs?: number };

  /** Site ID (auto-generated if not provided) */
  siteId?: Uint8Array;
}
```

See § Usage Example for how the config is passed to `createSyncModule`.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Database } from '@quereus/quereus';
import { LevelDBModule, LevelDBStore, StoreEventEmitter } from 'quereus-store';
import { createSyncModule } from '@quereus/sync';

// 1. Store + event emitter
const storeEvents = new StoreEventEmitter();
const store = new LevelDBModule(storeEvents);

// 2. KV store for sync metadata
const kvStore = await LevelDBStore.open({ path: './sync-meta' });

// 3. Sync module
const { syncManager, syncEvents } = await createSyncModule(kvStore, storeEvents, {
  retentionHorizonMs: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
});

// 4. Register the store module with the database
const db = new Database();
db.registerModule('store', store);

// 5. Create tables (sync tracks changes automatically via storeEvents)
await db.exec(`
  create table users (id integer primary key, name text, email text)
  using store(path='./data')
`);

// 6. Subscribe to sync events for UI (update UI, invalidate caches, …)
syncEvents.onRemoteChange((event) => { /* event.changes */ });
syncEvents.onConflictResolved((event) => { /* event.table/column/winner */ });

// 7. Implement your transport layer
async function syncWithServer(ws: WebSocket) {
  const localChanges = await syncManager.getChangesSince(serverSiteId, lastServerHLC);
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'changes', data: localChanges }));

  ws.onmessage = async (msg) => {
    const result = await syncManager.applyChanges(JSON.parse(msg.data));
    console.log(`Applied ${result.applied} changes`);
  };
}
```

### Streaming Snapshot Example

For large databases, stream snapshots instead of loading everything into memory:

```typescript
// Server: Stream snapshot to client
async function sendSnapshot(ws: WebSocket) {
  for await (const chunk of syncManager.getSnapshotStream(1000)) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify(chunk));
  }
}

// Client: Apply streamed snapshot with progress
async function receiveSnapshot(ws: WebSocket) {
  const chunks = receiveChunks(ws); // Your async iterator over WebSocket messages

  await syncManager.applySnapshotStream(chunks, (progress) => {
    console.log(`Progress: ${progress.tablesProcessed}/${progress.totalTables} tables`);
    console.log(`Entries: ${progress.entriesProcessed}/${progress.totalEntries}`);
  });
}

// Client: ask the server to resume an interrupted snapshot. The checkpoint MUST go
// through serializeSnapshotCheckpoint — it holds a Uint8Array siteId and a bigint
// HLC wallTime, and JSON.stringify throws on the bigint.
async function requestResume(ws: WebSocket, snapshotId: string) {
  const checkpoint = await syncManager.getSnapshotCheckpoint(snapshotId);
  if (!checkpoint) return;  // nothing saved — fall back to a fresh get_snapshot
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'resume_snapshot',
    checkpoint: serializeSnapshotCheckpoint(checkpoint),
  }));
  // Chunks come back exactly as for a fresh snapshot — apply them the same way
  await syncManager.applySnapshotStream(receiveChunks(ws));
}

// Server: resume streaming from the client's checkpoint
async function handleResume(ws: WebSocket, message: { checkpoint: SerializedSnapshotCheckpoint }) {
  for await (const chunk of syncManager.resumeSnapshotStream(
    deserializeSnapshotCheckpoint(message.checkpoint))) {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify(chunk));
  }
}
```

### Store Adapter for Remote Changes

`createStoreAdapter` builds a unified adapter for applying remote changes to LevelDB and IndexedDB stores:

```typescript
import { createStoreAdapter } from '@quereus/sync';

const applyToStore = createStoreAdapter(kvStore, storeEvents);
const syncManager = new SyncManagerImpl(metadataKvStore, storeEvents, applyToStore, {
  retentionHorizonMs: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
});
```

On inbound changes the adapter handles UPSERT semantics, deletes rows by primary key, executes DDL for schema changes, and emits events with `remote=true` so CRDT metadata is not re-recorded.

## Current limitations

The engine core is complete: HLC clocks, column-level LWW, tombstones,
transaction-grouped change extraction, streaming snapshots, schema synchronization,
reactive hooks, the LevelDB/IndexedDB store adapters, and the
[`@quereus/sync-client`](../packages/quereus-sync-client/) WebSocket client.

Known gaps, tracked in [`docs/todo.md` § Sync Engine Remaining Work](todo.md#sync-engine-remaining-work):

- **Per-table write atomicity** — remote changes are written data-first / metadata-second and
  abort with no metadata on any error (see [Transactional Integrity During Sync](#transactional-integrity-during-sync)),
  but do not yet use `WriteBatch` for per-table atomicity.
- **Isolation** — readers may observe partially-applied state mid-sync; true ACID isolation
  awaits Store-level support (see [Future: Store Isolation](#store-isolation-store-phase-8---future)).
- **Transports** — only the WebSocket client ships; HTTP-polling fallback is future work.
- **Test coverage** — tombstone-TTL fallback, large-dataset streaming, network-resume, and
  crash-recovery scenarios are not yet exercised.
