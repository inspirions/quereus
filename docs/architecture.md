# Quereus Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of the Quereus SQL engine: the pipeline from SQL text to result rows, the source layout, the conventions for extending the engine, and the design decisions that shape it. For the user-facing feature overview and quick start, see [`packages/quereus/README.md`](../packages/quereus/README.md). For what belongs in a design doc and how the docs are kept honest, see [Documentation Conventions](doc-conventions.md). For the numbered statements the code must satisfy — each naming the file that upholds it and the test that guards it — see the [Invariant Register](invariants.md).

## Pipeline Overview

Quereus is built on partially immutable `PlanNode`s and an instruction-based runtime with an attribute-based context system.

1. **SQL Input** — a SQL query string.
2. **Parser (`src/parser`)**
	* **Lexer (`lexer.ts`)** — tokenizes the raw SQL string.
	* **Parser (`parser.ts`)** — builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
3. **Planner (`src/planner`)**
	* Traverses the AST to construct a tree of immutable `PlanNode` objects representing the logical query structure.
	* Handles Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries by converting them into relational `PlanNode`s.
	* Resolves table and function references using the Schema Manager.
	* Performs query planning using each virtual table's `getBestAccessPlan` method and table/column statistics.
	* **Optimizer (`src/planner/optimizer`)** — transforms logical plans into efficient physical execution plans through a rule-based optimization system. See [Optimizer Documentation](optimizer.md).
4. **Runtime (`src/runtime`)**
	* **Emitters (`src/runtime/emitters.ts`, `src/runtime/emit/`)** — translate `PlanNode`s into a graph of `Instruction` objects.
	* **Scheduler (`src/runtime/scheduler.ts`)** — manages the execution flow of the `Instruction` graph.
	* **Instructions** — JavaScript functions operating on `RuntimeValue`s (either `SqlValue` or `AsyncIterable<Row>`). Async parameters are awaited.
	* Invokes virtual table methods (e.g., `query` which returns `AsyncIterable<Row>`, `update`) to interact with data.
	* Calls User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and aggregate functions.
	* Handles transaction and savepoint control.
5. **Virtual Tables (`src/vtab`)** — the core data interface. Modules implement `VirtualTableModule`. `MemoryTable` (`vtab/memory/table.ts`) is the reference implementation, using `digitree`.
6. **Schema Management (`src/schema`)** — manages schemas, tables, columns, functions.
7. **User-Defined Functions (`src/func`)** — support for custom JS functions in SQL.
8. **Core API (`src/core`)** — `Database`, `Statement` classes.

```

Key relationships: each PlanNode in `planner/nodes/` has a matching emitter in `runtime/emit/`. Optimizer rules in `planner/rules/` are registered in `planner/optimizer.ts` (as ordered entries in the `RULE_MANIFEST` array — array order is execution order). Tests go in `test/logic/*.sqllogic` (SQL logic tests) or `test/plan/` (plan shape tests).

## Common Implementation Patterns

**Adding a new PlanNode** (follow an existing node as template):
1. `planner/nodes/my-node.ts` — node class (e.g. copy `bloom-join-node.ts` for joins)
2. `planner/nodes/plan-node-type.ts` — add enum entry
3. `runtime/emit/my-node.ts` — matching emitter
4. `runtime/register.ts` — register the emitter: `registerEmitter(PlanNodeType.MyNode, emitMyNode)`
5. Tests in `test/logic/*.sqllogic` or `test/plan/`

**Adding an optimizer rule:**
1. `planner/rules/<category>/rule-my-rule.ts` (copy an existing rule in the same category)
2. Add an entry to `RULE_MANIFEST` in `planner/optimizer.ts` at the position that gives the ordering you need (array order = execution order)
3. Cost constants go in `planner/cost/index.ts`

**Adding a built-in function:**
1. `func/builtins/<category>.ts` (scalar.ts, string.ts, aggregate.ts, json.ts, datetime.ts, ...)
2. Register via `func/registration.ts`

All paths above are relative to `src/`.

## Key Design Decisions

*   **Federated / VTab-Centric** — all tables are virtual tables. Because remote virtual tables make join cost dominate, the optimizer aggressively eliminates joins whose non-preserved side is unused above the join when FK→PK alignment proves at-most-one-matching, often dropping a remote round-trip entirely. See [Optimizer Rules](optimizer-rules.md#optimization-rules).
*   **Async Core** — core operations are asynchronous. Cursors are `AsyncIterable<Row>`.
*   **Key-Based Addressing** — rows are identified by their defined Primary Key. No separate implicit `rowid`.
*   **Relational Orthogonality** — any statement that results in a relation can be used anywhere that expects a relation value, including mutating statements with RETURNING clauses.
*   **Declarative Schema (Optional)** — keep using DDL normally. Optionally use order‑independent `declare schema { ... }` to describe end‑state; the engine computes diffs against current state using module‑reported catalogs and emits canonical DDL. You may auto‑apply via `apply schema` or fetch the DDL and run it yourself (enabling custom backfills). Supports seeds, imports (URL + cache), versioning, and schema hashing. Destructive changes require explicit acknowledgement.
*   **JavaScript Types** — uses standard JavaScript types (`number`, `string`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `Uint8Array`, `null`) internally.
*   **Object-Based API** — uses classes (`Database`, `Statement`) to represent resources with lifecycles, rather than handles.
*   **Transient Schema** — schema information is primarily in-memory; persistence is not a goal. Emission of schema SQL export is supported.
*   **DDL Transactionality is a declared module capability** — because the schema catalog is transient (above), a schema change may escape the enclosing transaction. Each module declares how its DDL behaves via `getCapabilities().ddlTransactionality` (three tiers: `transactional`, `non-transactional`, `auto-commit`), and the `ddl_transaction_policy` option gates it: `permissive` (default, today's behavior) or `strict` (refuse module-dispatching DDL inside an explicit transaction unless the module is `transactional`). See [module-capabilities.md § DDL transactionality tiers](module-capabilities.md#ddl-transactionality-tiers) for the tier definitions.
*   **Multi-Schema Support** — organize tables across multiple schemas with flexible search paths for modular designs.
*   **Bags vs Sets Distinction** — explicit type-level distinction between relations that guarantee unique rows (sets) and those that allow duplicates (bags), enabling sophisticated optimizations and maintaining algebraic correctness in line with Third Manifesto principles.
*   **Attribute-Based Context System** — robust column reference resolution using stable attribute IDs eliminates architectural fragilities and provides deterministic context lookup across plan transformations. An attribute ID is *originated* once (at the node that mints it) but may be *forwarded* — re-published verbatim — by any number of ancestors (Set / Join / EagerPrefetch / AsyncGather, simple column-ref projections); the invariant is "originated once", not "appears once". See [Optimizer Documentation §Attribute provenance](optimizer.md#attribute-provenance).
*   **Functional-Dependency Tracking** — every relational physical node carries optional `fds` and `equivClasses` fields. Unique keys are encoded as `K → (all_cols \ K)` FDs (with `∅ → all_cols` for at-most-one-row claims), so a single surface answers both "what determines what" and "is this column set unique?". Operators propagate per-column FDs (e.g., `col1 = const` ⇒ `∅ → col1`, equi-joins ⇒ bi-directional FDs) and equivalence classes through the plan, giving optimizer rules a first-class signal beyond just superkeys. Declared `CHECK` constraints contribute additional FDs, EC pairs, constant bindings, and per-column `domainConstraints` (range / enum bounds) at the table reference, all propagated through the same per-operator rules. Because a uniqueness fact can live on any of three surfaces (`RelationType.keys`, the FD set, or `RelationType.isSet`), consumers read it through one reconciling pair — `keysOf` / `isUnique` in `planner/util/fd-utils.ts` — which is sound by construction (never claims a key that does not hold) and best-effort complete (the candidate-key enumeration is bounded, not exhaustive). See [Functional Dependency Tracking](optimizer-fd.md#functional-dependency-tracking).
*   **Per-Statement Change-Scope Introspection** — `Statement.getChangeScope()` returns a JSON-serializable `ChangeScope` describing what base-table state and external inputs the statement reads from, backed by the FD-aware binding analysis used by assertions and reactive watches. See [Change-scope Documentation](change-scope.md).
*   **Orthogonal Query Expressions** — `SELECT`, `VALUES`, and DML-with-`RETURNING` are accepted as a single `QueryExpr` shape everywhere a relation is needed (top-level statement, FROM subquery source, scalar / IN / EXISTS subquery, compound legs, CTE bodies). The parser flows every relation site through one `parseQueryExpr` helper; the AST collapses `MutatingSubquerySource` into the standard `SubquerySource` and `InsertStmt.{values, select}` into a single `source: QueryExpr`. All three forms execute at every relation site; DML inners in scalar / `IN` / `EXISTS` position run under full-drain + run-once semantics applied by the runtime emitters (gated on `physical.readonly === false`). DML as a view body is rejected at view-creation time — a view re-evaluates on every reference, and replaying a write per read is incoherent with view semantics. See [SQL Reference § Query expressions](sql-select.md#query-expressions).
*   **Predicate-Driven View Updateability** — views, CTEs, and subqueries-in-`from` are uniformly mutable through `insert` / `update` / `delete`. A view-targeted DML is rewritten to target the underlying base table(s) and re-planned, so all constraint / conflict / FK / mutation-context machinery is reused verbatim and reads/writes through the view report the base tables to `getChangeScope()` / `Database.watch` for free. Single-source projection-and-filter views, two-table key-preserving inner joins, and n-way lens decompositions are writeable; omitted columns are recovered from constant FDs derived from equality selection predicates (`where color = 'green'` defaults `color`), base-column defaults, the body select's `with defaults (col = expr, …)` clause, and the FD/EC reconstruction chain; write routing is steered per-row by writable presence/membership columns (outer-join existence, set-op membership), not by tags. A relation is updateable iff a deterministic decomposition exists at plan time; otherwise a structured diagnostic (`no-inverse` / `predicate-contradiction` / `recursive-cte` / …) names the obstruction. There is no `with check option`, no `instead of` triggers, and no view-level updateability flag — the FD framework subsumes the dialect-specific rules of other engines. See [View Updateability Documentation](view-updateability.md).
*   **Materialized Views** — `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` stores a query body as a *keyed derived relation* that is kept consistent with its sources **synchronously, inside the writing transaction** (row-time maintenance), so a materialized view is observably indistinguishable from the plain view it derives from — just served from a stored, primary-keyed backing table. There is one maintenance model and no refresh-policy knob: maintenance commits/rolls-back in lockstep with the source write, so there is no asynchronous drift to reconcile. Common shapes (single-source projection-filter, single-source aggregate, single-source lateral-TVF fan-out, and 1:1 inner/cross join) are kept by a **bounded per-row delta** — a per-row projection or a key-filtered residual; every other shape is maintained by an always-correct **full-rebuild floor** that re-evaluates the body once per writing statement, so **coverage is total — no body is rejected for its shape**. A backward (maintenance-direction) cost gate picks the cheapest sound strategy per body. The only create-time rejections are non-shape: a non-deterministic body, a bag (no provable unique key), a body with no relational output, and a full-rebuild-only body over a source past a configurable size threshold. Registered as exactly one schema object — an ordinary `TableSchema` under the view's own name, carrying a `derivation` (`TableDerivation`) — read-only to direct DML, round-tripped through the declarative-schema pipeline (`bodyHash`-keyed rebuild on a definition change), and the substrate the covering-structure / lens layers build on. See [Materialized Views](materialized-views.md).
*   **Layered Schemas / Lenses** — a database separates into **logical** (embodiment-free design: tables, types, logical constraints, tags — no module, no indexes), **basis** (module-backed relations, possibly federated across modules; covering structures live here as materialized views), and a **mapping** layer of per-logical-table **lenses**. A lens is the bidirectional (`get`/`put`) relational expression realizing a logical table over basis — built on view updateability, so relational algebra is the only operator set in both directions. Lens bodies are authored as **sparse overrides** (rename, hide, compute, …) over a module-pluggable default mapping, merged per-attribute and gap-filled by the compiler; the logical spec's constraints are *attached* at the lens boundary (predicates are read-time filters, not invariants), and the lens prover discharges the GetPut/PutGet completeness checks and classifies each constraint into an enforcement obligation (row-local check, child/parent-side FK, set-level uniqueness). At deploy the lens compiles to an inline view so the query processor sees an ordinary view; the basis is a generated-then-frozen, hash-coded artifact diffed by the declarative-schema pipeline, with logical removals detaching mappings rather than dropping basis storage. Modules advertise their own logical→basis mapping (columnar decomposition, EAV, column-family) so the default mapper can synthesize the n-way join in both directions. See [Lenses and Layered Schemas](lens.md). The layered model is also the substrate for evolving schemas across synced replicas — versioned-lens deployments over a frozen, shared basis whose tables are identity- and configuration-stable, with parallel maintained tables carrying representation changes; see [Schema Migration in a Synced Database](migration.md).

## Design Differences from SQLite

While Quereus supports standard SQL syntax, it has several distinctive design choices:

*   **Modern Type System** — uses logical/physical type separation instead of SQLite's type affinity model. Includes native temporal types (DATE, TIME, DATETIME) and JSON type with deep equality comparison. Conversion functions (`integer()`, `date()`, `json()`) are preferred over CAST syntax. All expressions have known types at plan time, including parameters; cross-category comparisons (e.g., numeric vs text) are handled via explicit conversions rather than implicit runtime coercion. See [Type System Documentation](types.md).
*   **Virtual Table Centric** — uses `CREATE TABLE ... USING module(...)` syntax. All tables are virtual tables.
*   **Default NOT NULL Columns** — following Third Manifesto principles, columns default to NOT NULL unless explicitly specified otherwise. This behavior can be controlled via `pragma default_column_nullability = 'nullable'` to restore SQL standard behavior.
*   **No Rowids** — all tables are addressed by their Primary Key. When no explicit PRIMARY KEY is defined, Quereus includes all columns in the primary key.
*   **Async API** — core execution is asynchronous with async/await patterns throughout.
*   **No Triggers or Built-in Persistence** — persistent storage can be implemented as a VTab module.

## Constraints

- Row-level CHECKs that reference only the current row are enforced immediately.
- Row-level CHECKs that reference other tables (e.g., via subqueries) are automatically deferred and enforced at COMMIT using the same optimized engine as global assertions. No `DEFERRABLE` or `SET CONSTRAINTS` management is required by the user.
- `CREATE ASSERTION name CHECK (...)` defines database-wide invariants evaluated at COMMIT.
- **Assertion-as-premise hoisting.** Assertions whose CHECK matches `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM T [WHERE P])` over a single base table are also surfaced to the optimizer as if `T` carried a per-row `CHECK (NOT P)`. The negated predicate flows through the standard CHECK-extraction pipeline at `TableReferenceNode.computePhysical`, contributing FDs / equivalence classes / constant bindings / domain constraints tagged with `source: { kind: 'assertion', name }`. Commit-time enforcement remains the source of truth; the hoisted facts are an additive optimizer signal that lets contradicting queries fold to `EmptyRelation`. See [Functional Dependencies § Assertion-derived premises](optimizer-fd.md#assertion-derived-premises).
- **Assertion delta classification.** Each table reference in an assertion's violation plan is classified as `'row'`, `'group'`, or `'global'`. All three modes are dispatched by a reusable `DeltaExecutor` kernel at COMMIT time: `'row'` runs a parameterized variant per changed PK; `'group'` parameterizes per changed group key (with OLD/NEW projections for group-membership transitions); `'global'` runs the full violation query once. The same kernel is the integration point for reactive signals and triggers — see [Incremental Maintenance](incremental-maintenance.md) and [Optimizer Assertion Analysis](optimizer-assertions.md#binding-aware-delta-planning-reusable). (Materialized views are maintained synchronously at the row-write boundary, not through this post-commit kernel — see [Materialized Views](materialized-views.md).)
- `FOREIGN KEY ... REFERENCES` with `ON DELETE CASCADE/SET NULL/RESTRICT` and `ON UPDATE CASCADE/SET NULL/RESTRICT`. Parent-side RESTRICT is enforced per mutated row, except that a non-lens DELETE/UPDATE under ABORT/ROLLBACK whose inbound FKs are all non-self-referential RESTRICT is checked with one batched probe per FK at end of statement instead — same final state and error, O(1) probes per statement rather than per row. See [Runtime § Batched RESTRICT](runtime.md#batched-restrict).
- **`committed.tablename` pseudo-schema** — provides read-only access to the pre-transaction (committed) state of any table. Enables transition constraints that compare current and committed state (e.g., `CREATE ASSERTION no_decrease CHECK (NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM t JOIN committed.t ct ON t.id = ct.id WHERE t.val < ct.val))`). The committed view is pinned to the transaction-start snapshot and is unaffected by savepoints.
- **Determinism Enforcement** — by default, CHECK constraints, DEFAULT values, and `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` expressions must use only deterministic expressions; non-deterministic values (like `datetime('now')` or `random()`) are passed via mutation context. The strictness is opt-out: setting `pragma nondeterministic_schema = true` (or `db.setOption('nondeterministic_schema', true)`) lifts the static rejection. The real invariant is that the captured artifact at `vtab.update()` is fully resolved — per-row evaluation already produces concrete values in `args.values` and in the literal SQL emitted by `buildInsertStatement` / `buildUpdateStatement` / `buildDeleteStatement` (see [Module Authoring](module-authoring.md#mutation-statements)). A deferred CHECK with non-deterministic expressions evaluates once at commit; if it passes, the transaction's writes enter the log atomically and replay applies them at the module-layer boundary without re-evaluation, so deferred non-det is replay-safe by transaction atomicity. See [Determinism Validation](determinism.md).
- **Conflict Resolution** — `INSERT OR {IGNORE,REPLACE,FAIL,ABORT,ROLLBACK}` covers every constraint class (NOT NULL, CHECK, FK existence, UNIQUE/PK). Column- and table-level `ON CONFLICT <action>` directives are honored as the per-constraint default; statement-level `OR` clauses always win. A subquery-deferred CHECK is evaluated at row time (not commit) when the active conflict resolution is non-default, so IGNORE/REPLACE can drop or substitute the row in place. The statement-level `OR <action>` clause is accepted on `INSERT` only; `UPDATE OR` / `DELETE OR` are a deliberate non-goal (the syntax has no precedent outside SQLite) — use schema-level `ON CONFLICT <action>` on the constraint for UPDATE conflict handling. See [SQL Reference](sql-dml.md#conflict-resolution-or-clause).

  Action semantics summary:

  | Class | IGNORE | REPLACE | FAIL | ABORT | ROLLBACK |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | NOT NULL (with DEFAULT) | skip row | substitute DEFAULT | abort stmt | abort stmt | abort stmt + rollback tx |
  | NOT NULL (no DEFAULT) | skip row | abort stmt | abort stmt | abort stmt | abort stmt + rollback tx |
  | CHECK | skip row | abort stmt | abort stmt | abort stmt | abort stmt + rollback tx |
  | FK existence | skip row | abort stmt | abort stmt | abort stmt | abort stmt + rollback tx |
  | UNIQUE / PK | skip row | replace existing | abort stmt | abort stmt | abort stmt + rollback tx |

  FAIL keeps prior rows of the same statement that already succeeded. ROLLBACK auto-rolls-back the enclosing transaction (implicit or explicit).

## Sequential ID Generation

Quereus has no built-in auto-increment or sequence objects. Instead, batch ID generation composes naturally from existing features: mutation context captures a non-deterministic seed once, a window function provides a deterministic per-row ordinal, and a scalar or table-valued function produces the final ID. For example, inserting with timestamp-derived IDs:

```sql
insert into orders (id, customer_id, total)
with context base_ts = epoch_ms('now')
select
    base_ts * 1000 + row_number() over (order by c.customer_id),
    c.customer_id,
    c.total
from (select customer_id, sum(price) as total from cart_items group by customer_id) c;
```

The `WITH CONTEXT` boundary captures `epoch_ms('now')` as a literal, and `row_number() over (order by ...)` assigns a deterministic ordinal over a declared ordering. The entire statement is replayable. For richer formats (ULIDs, UUIDv7), register a deterministic scalar UDF that encodes `(seed, counter)` into the desired format — or use a lateral join to a deterministic TVF when multiple columns are needed per generated row.

**`mutation_ordinal()` — the per-row ordinal in column-`default` position.** `row_number()` is a window function, so it reaches only query (`SELECT`) position. The same per-row ordinal is needed in a **column `default`**, where no window function can reach — most importantly for the [shared-key-via-default](vu-mutation-context.md#mutation-context) surrogate case, where the engine evaluates the anchor key column's `default` once per produced row and threads the value across a multi-table write. `mutation_ordinal()` is a first-class, **deterministic** nullary builtin returning the 1-based ordinal of the row being produced within the current statement; it is valid during INSERT-default / mutation-context evaluation and errors elsewhere. It composes the same ID story into the default position:

```sql
-- the surrogate-key allocator the engine used to fabricate, now authored as SQL:
create table orders (id integer primary key
                       default (coalesce((select max(id) from orders), 0) + mutation_ordinal()),
                     customer_id integer, total integer);
```

Being deterministic, it needs no `nondeterministic_schema` opt-out (a `max()` subquery + ordinal is a pure function of pre-mutation state). NB: in a **plain** single-source insert the rows are written incrementally, so a `max()`-based default already sees prior rows of the same statement — compose the ordinal with deterministic state directly there; the shared-key **envelope** instead freezes a pre-mutation snapshot, so `max() + mutation_ordinal()` is the correct monotonic allocator there.

## Optimizer

Quereus features a sophisticated rule-based query optimizer that transforms logical plans into efficient physical execution plans. The optimizer uses a single plan node hierarchy with logical-to-physical transformation, generic tree rewriting infrastructure, and comprehensive optimization rules including constant folding, intelligent caching, streaming aggregation, bloom (hash) join selection for equi-joins, and correlated subquery decorrelation (EXISTS/IN in a WHERE clause → semi/anti joins; EXISTS/IN or scalar aggregates in a SELECT list → existence-flag / grouped left joins).

See the [Optimizer Documentation](optimizer.md) for architecture details, [Functional Dependency Tracking](optimizer-fd.md) for the FD / EC / inclusion-dependency surface, and [Optimizer Conventions](optimizer-conventions.md) for development guidelines.

### Recent refinements

- Retrieve growth and push-down stabilized: query-based modules slide full nodes via `supports()`; index-style fallback injects supported-only fragments inside `Retrieve`, preserving residuals above.
- Retrieve logical properties now expose `bindingsCount` and `bindingsNodeTypes` (visible in `query_plan().properties`) to aid verification that parameters/correlations are captured.
- Table-valued functions can advertise relational and physical characteristics (keys, ordering, monotonicOn, estimated row count, etc.) via an optional `relationalAdvertisement` on `TableValuedFunctionSchema`. `TableFunctionCallNode.computePhysical` consumes the declaration on the standard physical-property path so FD propagation, DISTINCT/sort elimination, and cardinality-aware rules see the same information they get from a real vtab. See [Optimizer Retrieve Push-down](optimizer-retrieve.md#tvf-property-declarations).
- Functional-dependency framework: unique keys, equivalence classes, constant bindings, domain constraints, and guarded (conditional) FDs are now the canonical surface for "what determines what" on a relational node's output. Producers include declared PK/UNIQUE, declared CHECK (including implication-form disjunctions), partial UNIQUE indexes, and statically-classified `CREATE ASSERTION` premises; consumers include DISTINCT elimination, GROUP BY simplification, ORDER BY pruning, predicate-inference-via-EC, sargable range rewrites, predicate contradiction detection, FK→PK join elimination, and FK-driven semi/anti-join folding. See [Functional Dependency Tracking](optimizer-fd.md#functional-dependency-tracking).
- Change-detection / delta API: every prepared `Statement` exposes a JSON-serializable `ChangeScope` describing what base-table state (full / rows / groups / rowsByGroup) and external inputs it depends on; `Database.watch(scope, handler)` registers post-commit reactive callbacks on the same shape. The internal counterpart is a reusable `DeltaExecutor` that powers transaction-deferred assertions and `Database.watch` today and is positioned to power reactive signals and triggers. (Materialized views moved off this post-commit kernel to synchronous row-time maintenance.) See [Change-scope Documentation](change-scope.md), [Incremental Maintenance](incremental-maintenance.md), and the [Usage Guide](usage.md#change-scope-introspection).
- `ParallelDriver` runtime primitive (`src/runtime/parallel-driver.ts`): forks `RuntimeContext` into N independent child views and drives N branch factories concurrently with bounded concurrency and `AbortSignal` cancellation. Foundation for the broader `parallel-*` track; no plan-node consumers yet. See [Parallel Runtime § ParallelDriver](runtime-parallel.md#paralleldriver-runtime-primitive).
- `EagerPrefetchNode` (`src/planner/nodes/eager-prefetch-node.ts`): latency-hiding physical pass-through that forks the runtime context on emit and pumps the child sub-tree into a bounded ring buffer immediately, so the consumer's first await finds rows already in flight. First downstream consumer of `ParallelDriver.fork()`; rows/keys/FDs/orderings pass through verbatim. See [Parallel Runtime § EagerPrefetchNode](runtime-parallel.md#eagerprefetchnode-first-paralleldriverfork-consumer).
- Concurrent committed-read path (`src/core/database.ts`, `src/core/statement.ts`): statement execution serializes through the exec mutex — with one opt-in exception. A read-only statement executed with `readConcurrency: 'committed'` (`StatementOptions`) that passes `Database._isConcurrentReadEligible` runs WITHOUT the mutex: every table scan connects with `_readCommitted: true` (`RuntimeContext.readCommitted`, OR-ed into the scan emitter's connect options), serving each table's last committed state, so the read completes even while another statement is parked inside a slow virtual-table commit. Gated per table on the module-declared `readCommittedSnapshot` flag (`getModuleReadCommittedSnapshot`; memory vtab declares it, the isolation wrapper mirrors its underlying — its committed reads get their own dedicated underlying handle and bypass the overlay — store declines; fail closed), and refused wholesale inside an explicit `BEGIN`, for any non-relational or side-effecting statement, for any surviving `TableFunctionCallNode` (a TVF sits outside the table gate and reports `readonly` unconditionally, yet the tracing TVFs run arbitrary SQL), and for multi-statement `eval` batches — ineligible statements silently fall back to the serialized path. A concurrent read never joins the writer's transaction, never registers a connection, and never touches the implicit-transaction lifecycle; `Database.close()` aborts live concurrent reads and awaits their teardown. See [Usage § Concurrent Committed Reads](usage.md#concurrent-committed-reads-readconcurrency) and [Module Authoring § Committed-Snapshot Reads](module-authoring.md#4-committed-snapshot-reads-_readcommitted).
- Module concurrency contract (`src/vtab/module.ts`, `src/vtab/concurrency.ts`): `VirtualTableModule.concurrencyMode` declares `'serial'` (default), `'reentrant-reads'`, or `'fully-reentrant'`. Memory vtab is `'reentrant-reads'` — `query()` captures `pendingTransactionLayer ?? readLayer` at call entry and iterates that captured BTree, so concurrent `query()` calls on a single connection see consistent snapshots. Writes still serialize because once a transaction is open, subsequent writes mutate the existing pending layer's BTree in place; `'fully-reentrant'` would require fresh-per-write layers or an iterator-safe mutation path, neither of which has been audited. Everything else stays default. Parallel runtime consumers call `getModuleConcurrencyMode(module)` and `acquireConnectionLock(connection)` to fall back to serial behavior when sibling branches share a connection. The lock is not enforced by `ParallelDriver` itself — enforcement belongs in the consumer that owns the vtab interaction (e.g. fan-out lookup join).
- `AsyncGatherNode` (`src/planner/nodes/async-gather-node.ts`): N-ary physical relational combinator that drives ≥ 2 independent children concurrently via `ParallelDriver.drive()`. Three combinators ship — `unionAll` (arrival-order interleave), `crossProduct` (materialized N-ary Cartesian product), and `zipByKey` (full N-way outer join on shared key columns, eager BTree hash-merge). Manual-construction only; recognition of chained `SetOperationNode(op='unionAll')` lands separately in `5.5-parallel-async-gather-union-all-rule`. `crossProduct` recognition is opt-in and not currently on the optimizer roadmap. The `zipByKey` recognition rule has landed (`src/planner/rules/parallel/rule-async-gather-zip-by-key.ts`): it folds a `Project` over a shared-key full-outer `JoinNode` chain, recognizing arbitrary projection order / derived scalars over the merged key (canonical order replaces the `Project` outright; any other order wraps the gather in a thin reordering `Project`). See [Optimizer § Async gather ZIP BY KEY](optimizer-parallel.md#async-gather-zip-by-key) and [Parallel Runtime § AsyncGatherNode](runtime-parallel.md#asyncgathernode-n-ary-parallel-relational-combinator).
- `FanOutLookupJoinNode` (`src/planner/nodes/fanout-lookup-join-node.ts`): physical relational node that, for one outer row, forks N parameterized child sub-plans, drives them concurrently via `ParallelDriver.drive()` (bounded by `concurrencyCap`), collects each branch's at-most-one lookup row, and composes a wide result. Replaces a chain of N FK→PK LEFT/INNER joins. v1 supports `atMostOne-left` and `atMostOne-inner` branch modes only; `array` / `cross` are deferred. Per-branch `concurrencySafe` plus `acquireConnectionLock` integrates the vtab concurrency contract. The recognition rule has landed and is registered (`src/planner/rules/join/rule-fanout-lookup-join.ts`, registered in `planner/optimizer.ts`), clustering FK→PK join-spine and correlated scalar-aggregate subquery branches into a `FanOutLookupJoinNode` when the cost gate approves. See [Parallel Runtime § FanOutLookupJoinNode](runtime-parallel.md#fanoutlookupjoinnode-per-row-fan-out-lookup-join).
- Side-effect audit discipline: every registered optimization rule declares `sideEffectMode: 'safe' | 'aware'` at registration time, and the registry rejects rules that fail to declare. Rules that move, duplicate, drop, or merge subtrees ('aware') consult `PlanNodeCharacteristics.subtreeHasSideEffects` and refuse / weaken when any participating subtree carries a write — the safety net that `dml-in-expression-position` (parallel ticket) and FROM-position DML write-target propagation in `ChangeScope` stand on. See [Optimizer § Audit discipline](optimizer.md#audit-discipline-sideeffectmode).

## Testing Strategy

The tests are located in `test/*.spec.ts` and are driven by Mocha with ts-node/esm.

```bash
yarn test
```

Quereus employs a multi-faceted testing strategy:

1.  **SQL Logic Tests (`test/logic/`)**
	*   Inspired by SQLite's own testing methodology.
	*   Uses simple text files (`*.sqllogic`) containing SQL statements and their expected JSON results (using `→` marker) or expected error messages (using `-- error:` directive).
	*   `-- requires-capability: <tokens>` lets a file declare database features it needs, so a backend that deliberately lacks one skips the whole file instead of maintaining its own file list. The corpus is shared across projects, so the format is a cross-repo contract — spec lives in [`packages/quereus/test/README.md`](../packages/quereus/test/README.md) § `-- requires-capability:` directive.
	*   Driven by a Mocha test runner (`test/logic.spec.ts`) that executes the SQL against a fresh `Database` instance for each file.
	*   **Configurable Diagnostics** — on unexpected failures, the test runner provides clean error messages by default with optional detailed diagnostics controlled by command line arguments:
		*   `yarn test --verbose` — show execution progress during tests
		*   `yarn test --show-plan` — include concise query plan in diagnostics
		*   `yarn test --plan-full-detail` — include full detailed query plan (JSON format)
		*   `yarn test --plan-summary` — show one-line execution path summary
		*   `yarn test --expand-nodes node1,node2...` — expand specific nodes in concise plan
		*   `yarn test --max-plan-depth N` — limit plan display depth
		*   `yarn test --show-program` — include instruction program in diagnostics
		*   `yarn test --show-stack` — include full stack trace in diagnostics
		*   `yarn test --show-trace` — include execution trace in diagnostics
		*   `yarn test --trace-plan-stack` — enable plan stack tracing in runtime
	*   This helps pinpoint failures at the Parser, Planner, or Runtime layer while keeping output manageable.
	*   Provides comprehensive coverage of SQL features: basic CRUD, complex expressions, all join types, window functions, aggregates, subqueries, CTEs, constraints, transactions, set operations, views, and error handling.

2.  **Property-Based Tests (`test/property.spec.ts`)**
	*   Uses the `fast-check` library to generate a wide range of inputs for specific, tricky areas.
	*   Focuses on verifying fundamental properties and invariants that should hold true across many different values.
	*   Currently includes tests for:
		*   **Collation Consistency** — ensures `ORDER BY` results match the collation function the connection resolves (`db.getCollationResolver()`) for `BINARY`, `NOCASE`, and `RTRIM` across various strings.
		*   **Numeric Affinity** — verifies that comparisons (`=`, `<`) in SQL handle mixed types (numbers, strings, booleans, nulls) consistently with SQLite's affinity rules, using `compareSqlValues` as the reference.
		*   **JSON Roundtrip** — confirms that arbitrary JSON values survive being processed by `json_quote()` and `json_extract('$')` without data loss or corruption.
		*   **Mixed Type Arithmetic** — checks that arithmetic on mixed types behaves consistently between SELECT and WHERE contexts.
		*   **Parser Robustness** — feeds random strings, SQL-like fragment mixtures, and random identifiers to the parser, asserting it either produces a valid AST or throws `QuereusError` — never unhandled exceptions.
		*   **Expression Evaluation** — compares random arithmetic expression trees and boolean comparisons evaluated in SQL against JS semantics.
		*   **Comparison Properties** — validates `compareSqlValues` maintains antisymmetry, reflexivity, and transitivity across mixed types.
		*   **Insert/Select Roundtrip** — tests value preservation through insert+select for INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB, and ANY column types.
		*   **ORDER BY Determinism** — verifies repeated ORDER BY queries on data with duplicate sort keys produce identical results.
		*   **Key Soundness** — over a zoo of query shapes (scans, projections, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY/LIMIT, set operations, joins, nested subqueries) and random table seeds, asserts the optimizer's uniqueness facts (`keysOf()` / `RelationType.isSet`) never *over-claim* against actual rows: a declared key is never duplicated and `isSet` rows are never repeated (soundness, not completeness — a missing key is fine, a false one is not). **Tier 1** checks the top result node of each shape (rows via `db.eval`, matched to keys positionally by column name). **Tier 2** walks *every* relational node in the optimized plan tree, materializes each in isolation (`emitPlanNode` + `Scheduler.run` with a strict, table-context-free runtime), and runs the same positional assertions on that node's own rows — pinning each operator's `getType()` / `computePhysical` independent of whether a shape surfaces it at the top. Tier 2 is best-effort: nodes that cannot emit/run standalone (correlated / parameterized inner nodes, the connection-bound `TableReference`) are *skipped*, and a `checkedNodes > 0` guard keeps the tier from silently degenerating into all-skips.
		*   **AST Round-Trip (`test/emit-roundtrip-property.spec.ts`)** — generates AST nodes and asserts `parse(stringify(ast)) ≡ ast` via a structural comparator (`test/emit-roundtrip-comparator.ts`) that drops positional metadata and applies documented default-equivalences. Catches stealth field-drops in `emit/ast-stringify.ts` that the string-equality round-trip in `emit-roundtrip.spec.ts` cannot detect.
		*   **View Round-Trip Laws (`test/property.spec.ts` § View Round-Trip Laws)** — the backward-direction soundness net (the dual of the Key Soundness forward net) for the shipped single-source projection-and-filter write-through path (`analysis/update-lineage.ts` → the Phase-1 rewrite in `building/view-mutation.ts`). Over a view-body zoo (bare `select *`, explicit / rename projection, computed column, equality-filter, alias-qualified body) and random base seeds it asserts three laws: **PutGet** — an insert/update/delete through the view never escapes the view predicate (base rows outside it are untouched) and computed columns are read-only (a write reds with the `no-inverse` diagnostic, not silently dropped), with the post-state view image cross-checked against the base; **GetPut** — reading a row and writing the same values back via the identifying predicate leaves the base unchanged; **forward/backward lineage agreement** — every forward key (`keysOf` / `isUnique`) is `base`-writable and reconstructs the base identifying predicate, and a base PK that survives projection is advertised as a forward key. LIMIT/OFFSET/DISTINCT bodies are asserted to *reject* rather than silently widen. Like Key Soundness it pairs a pure law core with a negative self-test that proves each core reds on an injected violation. Implements the `bx-operator-model-and-roundtrip-laws` spike's Tier A; `view-mutation-plan-node-substrate` extends the same block to the planned multi-source tree (see `docs/view-updateability.md` § Round-Trip Laws and the Derived Backward Walk).
		*   **Declarative-Schema Equivalence (`test/declarative-equivalence.spec.ts` + property suite in `test/property.spec.ts`)** — for each shape in a curated corpus and a `fast-check`-generated table arbitrary, builds two databases in parallel — one via direct `create table` / `create view` DDL, one via `declare schema main { ... } apply schema main` — and asserts the resulting `TableSchema` / `ViewSchema` / `IntegrityAssertionSchema` objects compare equal (via `test/util/schema-equivalence.ts`) and that hand-written DML probes return identical row sets / error classes against both. Guards the contract that the declarative pipeline never silently re-shapes a constraint, default, generated column, FK action, partial-index predicate, or view body. Issues #21 (view compound-select first-leg loss), #22 (CHECK `not in` parser dropping the parenthesisation), and #23 (CHECK `on delete` mask drop) are the regression fingerprints this harness is shaped against.
		*   **Grammar-Based SQL Fuzzing (`test/fuzz.spec.ts`)** — generates random schemas, seed data, and SQL (SELECT/DML/CTE/window/compound) and asserts the engine never throws a non-`QuereusError`, plus algebraic invariants (COUNT vs iteration, DISTINCT uniqueness, UNION/EXCEPT/INTERSECT laws) and optimizer differential equivalence (same query/data with rewrite-rule groups disabled must yield identical result sets). **Reproducibility:** the suite is random by default but resolves one base seed per process and prints `[fuzz] QUEREUS_FUZZ_SEED=<n>` at startup, feeding it to every `fc.assert` *and* `fc.sample`. To replay a failure — most importantly an opaque Mocha *timeout*, which kills the test before fast-check can report its own seed — re-run with that env var set: `QUEREUS_FUZZ_SEED=<n> node packages/quereus/test-runner.mjs --grep Fuzzing`.

3.  **Performance Sentinels (`test/performance-sentinels.spec.ts`)**
	*   Micro-benchmarks with generous thresholds to catch severe performance regressions.
	*   Currently includes sentinels for: parser throughput (simple, wide-SELECT, nested-expression), query execution (full table scan), and self-join (nested-loop baseline).
	*   Thresholds are intentionally generous to avoid flakiness while still catching order-of-magnitude regressions.

4.  **Unit Tests (`test/*.spec.ts`)**
	*   Dedicated unit tests for core subsystems: type system (`type-system.spec.ts`), schema manager (`schema-manager.spec.ts`), optimizer rules (`optimizer/*.spec.ts`), memory vtable (`memory-vtable.spec.ts`), utility functions (`utility-edge-cases.spec.ts`).
	*   Integration boundary tests (`integration-boundaries.spec.ts`) verify all boundary transitions: Parser→Planner, Planner→Optimizer, Optimizer→Runtime, Runtime→VTab.
	*   Golden plan tests (`plan/golden-plans.spec.ts`) use snapshot testing to detect unintended query plan changes.
	*   **Parallel-runtime / concurrency tests** guard the `parallel-*` track against timing races, and are **deterministic by construction** — they never assert on wall-clock elapsed time. `test/util/controllable-source.ts` provides gate-driven async sources plus a `ConcurrencyTracker`, so `test/runtime/{parallel-driver,async-gather,eager-prefetch,fanout-lookup-join}.spec.ts` prove parallelism via peak-in-flight counts and forced interleavings rather than `setTimeout` deltas. `test/runtime/fork-contract.spec.ts` pins every `RuntimeContext` field to a fork policy and statically allowlists context-mutation sites; `test/vtab/concurrent-scan.spec.ts` overlaps memory-vtab `query()` iterators at the vtab layer (bypassing the exec mutex) to validate the `reentrant-reads` snapshot contract; `test/vtab/concurrency-mode.spec.ts` covers `acquireConnectionLock` FIFO fairness, mutual exclusion, and batched-outer contention. The **strict-fork** runtime guard (`QUEREUS_FORK_STRICT=1`) throws if a parent context is mutated while a fork is being driven, and runs as part of `yarn check` via `test:fork-strict`. See [Parallel Runtime § Parallel runtime fork contract](runtime-parallel.md#parallel-runtime-fork-contract).

5.  **Benchmark Suite (`bench/`)**
	*   Standalone benchmark harness run via `yarn bench`. Measures parser, planner, execution, and mutation throughput across 26 benchmarks, including text-comparison-sensitive `order by` / `distinct` / text-primary-key cases (the `BINARY` collation comparator is the engine's hottest).
	*   Records results to timestamped JSON files in `bench/results/` (gitignored).
	*   `yarn bench --baseline <file>` compares against a previous result, color-codes regressions (>20% red) and improvements (>10% green), and exits non-zero on regressions.

6.  **CI Integration (Planned)**
	*   Utilize GitHub Actions (or similar) to run test suites automatically, potentially with different configurations (quick checks, full runs, browser environment).

This layered approach aims for broad coverage via the logic tests, unit tests for individual subsystems, property tests to explore edge cases, performance sentinels to guard against regressions, and a dedicated benchmark suite for tracking performance over time.
