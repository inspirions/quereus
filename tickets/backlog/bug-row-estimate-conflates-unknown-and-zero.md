description: The query planner writes down "how many rows do I expect here" as a plain number, with no way to say "I have no idea" — so a table nobody has gathered statistics for reports zero, and different parts of the planner read that zero as "empty", as "unknown", or as proof that a read can be deleted entirely.

tradeoffs: Changing the estimate representation touches every plan node and every storage module that answers an access-plan request — a wide, mechanical, backwards-incompatible change whose payoff is mostly better plans rather than fixed answers, so a maintainer may prefer to patch the two consumers that misread zero today.
----

# One number is asked to mean three different things

`estimatedRows` is a plain number on every plan node and on every access-plan answer a
storage module returns. It is currently used to express three distinct claims:

| claim | how it is spelled today |
|---|---|
| "I estimate about N rows" | `N` |
| "I have no idea" | `0` (a table that has never been `ANALYZE`d) |
| "I have proven nothing can match" | `0` (a module answering an access-plan request) |

`SchemaManager` hardcodes `TableSchema.estimatedRows` to 0 when a table is created, and
`vtab/memory/module.ts` reads the same field back as `request.estimatedRows || 1000`
*precisely because* 0 means unknown there. So both readings are live in the codebase at
once, and a fourth site treats 0 as a proof strong enough to delete a table read.

## The invariant that retires the class

Make the three claims separately representable, so a consumer cannot silently pick the
wrong one — e.g. a `RowEstimate` that is `{kind: 'unknown'} | {kind: 'estimate', rows}`
plus a distinct `provablyEmpty` flag on the access-plan answer, with the "no statistics"
default spelled `unknown` rather than `0`. Every consumer then has to say what it does
with `unknown`, and the compiler makes it say so.

Once that lands, the three arms below stop being defects and become two-line decisions.

## Arm 1 — the CTE caching gate reads "unknown" as "empty" (verified)

`ruleCteOptimization` decides whether to keep a `with …` result in memory from a row
estimate alone:

```ts
const sourceSize = PlanNodeCharacteristics.estimatesRows(source);
const shouldCache = (
    cteNode.materializationHint === 'materialized' ||
    (sourceSize > 0 && sourceSize < context.tuning.cte.maxSizeForCaching)
) && !isAlreadyCached;
```

`sourceSize > 0` is false for every un-analyzed database, so **whether the engine
caches a CTE depends on whether a maintenance command has been run**, not on anything
about the query.

The gate also never looks at how many times the CTE name is used. Once a real estimate
does arrive, it passes for *every* CTE in range, including single-use ones — which two
existing specs say should be inlined (`plan-shape-decisions.spec.ts` "CTE referenced
once is inlined (no CACHE node)" and `cte-materialization.spec.ts` "does not produce a
CACHE node for single-use CTE"). Those specs pass today **only because the estimate
happens to be 0**, so fixing the unknown-vs-zero reading without also adding a
reference count turns them red.

## Arm 2 — a zero estimate is read as proof of emptiness (static)

When the planner asks a storage backend how it would read a table, a **zero** row count
makes the planner conclude the read can produce nothing and replaces it with a static
empty result — no storage access, ever. That conclusion is a *proof*, but the field it
is read out of is documented as an *estimate*. A backend that rounds a very selective
estimate down to zero, or that reports how big the table is right now, makes the strong
claim without meaning to.

The worst arm is already closed: the fold used to fire on a plan with **no filters at
all**, because the guard restricting it to the proven-impossible case
(`handledFilters.every(...)`) is vacuously true over an empty list — so a backend
reporting an honest live size of zero for a plain full scan had its table read deleted,
and planning precedes execution, so "empty now" was not "empty later". What remains is
the representation problem: the interface still has no way to distinguish the two claims.

## Arm 3 — estimates stop existing at set operations

`SetOperationNode` has no `estimatedRows` getter at all and its `computePhysical` never
stamps one, so a query whose results are combined with `union` / `union all` /
`intersect` / `except` reports **no row count from the combine point upward**, in either
the logical or the physical view. Everything above it — sorts, enclosing joins, cache
sizing — falls back to a fixed default. `union all` is common, so this is the largest of
the gaps.

Three smaller groups have the same hole: `AsyncGatherNode` (has a logical getter that
composes its branches, but no physical one — and a PostOptimization rule substitutes it
for `union all` on high-latency plans), the CTE nodes (`cte-node.ts`,
`cte-reference-node.ts`), and the DML family (`delete-node.ts`,
`dml-executor-node.ts`, `returning-node.ts`, `insert-node.ts`, `remote-query-node.ts`).

`debt-join-rows-from-physical-children` already moved the single-source operators and
the join family onto `physicalSourceRows`; these four groups were left out.

## Notes for whoever picks this up

- Arm 3 is a *producer* gap and arms 1–2 are *consumer* gaps. Filling arm 3 without
  fixing arm 1 makes the CTE caching behaviour change for every user at once — the
  producer work should not land first.
- `docs/module-authoring.md` states the access-plan `rows` contract in prose only; a
  representation change is the chance to make it checkable.
