description: On the in-memory tables, adding an index on a column that already has a uniqueness rule leaves the database maintaining two identical hidden structures forever; the persistent store now collapses them into one and memory should match.

# Memory backend: re-decide unique-index reuse when an index is created or dropped

A plain `UNIQUE` (a column-level `email text unique`, or a table-level `unique (email)`)
is enforced through an automatically-built secondary index that the user never sees. Both
built-in backends build one.

The memory backend decides whether it needs that hidden index **once, when the table
object is constructed**. If a matching user index already exists at that moment it reuses
it; otherwise it builds its own and never revisits the decision. So:

```sql
create table t (id integer primary key, email text unique);
create index ix on t (email);          -- memory now maintains TWO identical structures
```

leaves both structures maintained for the life of the table — every insert, update and
delete writes the same entry twice. Declaring the index *before* the constraint exists is
not possible for an inline `UNIQUE`, so the redundant case is the ordinary one.

The persistent store backend was changed to re-decide on every schema change: creating a
covering index retires the hidden one, dropping it rebuilds the hidden one from the live
rows. Memory should do the same.

## Expected behavior

- Creating a full (non-partial) index whose columns match a plain `UNIQUE`'s columns, in
  the same order, with matching per-column collations, should retire that constraint's
  auto-built index — one structure maintained, not two.
- Dropping that index should restore the auto-built index, populated from the rows present
  at that moment, so the very next write is still checked against every existing row.
- Enforcement must be indistinguishable throughout: duplicates rejected, `or ignore` /
  `or replace` unchanged, rows written while the user index was the enforcing structure
  still detected afterwards, rows deleted in that window not resurrected as phantoms.
- Non-reusable shapes must keep building the auto index: a partial index, a partial
  `UNIQUE`, an index over different or reordered columns, a collation-mismatched index.

## Why it is only cleanup

No behavior is wrong today — the two structures hold identical entries, so enforcement
answers the same either way. The cost is doubled index maintenance per write, plus the
memory the duplicate occupies. Also worth aligning because the two backends' reuse rules
are now documented as mirroring each other, and they no longer do.

`fix/bug-memory-unique-reuses-partial-index` changes the same function's reuse search
for a different reason: the condition currently admits a *filtered* index, so an
unfiltered UNIQUE adopts it and stops rejecting duplicates outside the filter. That is
a correctness fix to *which shapes qualify*; this ticket is about *when the decision is
re-taken*. Whichever lands second should re-read the other — the two edits are
adjacent, and the fix already realizes the "a partial index must keep building its own
structure" bullet listed above.

The store implementation is the reference for the reuse predicate (which shapes qualify)
and for the create/drop transition; the memory-side work is finding the equivalent of the
store's "reconcile on schema change" hook, since memory's index set lives in the layer
manager rather than behind a module DDL entry point.

## Second arm — a reused index leaves the constraint unable to find its own structure

*Added by the review of `bug-memory-unique-reuses-partial-index`. Same site (the reuse
arms), same "the reuse decision is never revisited" root cause, so it belongs here rather
than in its own ticket. Not a correctness bug — that hole was closed in that ticket — but
the reuse path is slower than the no-reuse path, which is backwards.*

When a `UNIQUE` constraint reuses an existing index, the manager records which structure
enforces it in a lookup table keyed by *the reused index's name*. But the reader derives
the key it looks up from the constraint instead — the constraint's own name, or the
`_uc_<column names>` auto-name when it is unnamed. For an **unnamed** constraint that
reused an index with any other name, those two keys differ, so the lookup never finds the
entry. Observed on the current tree (`alter table w add unique (c)` reusing a
`create unique index wu on w (c)`): the by-name lookup misses on every single write.

Each miss falls through to a scan of the table's index list to re-find a usable structure
by column set. That still lands on the right index, so the answer is correct — it is just
re-derived per write instead of being read from the lookup table.

It gets more expensive once the reused index is **dropped**. The recorded name then points
at an index that no longer exists, so the lookup misses for *named* constraints too, and
the column-set scan may find no admissible structure at all — at which point uniqueness is
enforced by a full table scan on every write, for the life of the table. That is the same
scenario this ticket's "dropping that index should restore the auto-built index" bullet
already calls for, which is why the two belong together.

Either half of the fix resolves it: rebuild the constraint's own structure when the index
it reused goes away (this ticket's main proposal), or record the covering structure under
the key the reader actually derives so reuse stays a fast path. The second is much smaller
but only addresses the live-index case.

Care needed: the key is also rewritten by the column-rename path
(`planImplicitCoveringIndexRenames` / `applyImplicitCoveringStructureRenames`) and the
constraint-drop path, so any re-keying has to move with those.
