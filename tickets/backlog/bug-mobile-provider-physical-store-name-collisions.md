description: Two of the mobile storage plugins invent their own physical storage names instead of using the shared naming helper, and one of them deletes punctuation from the name — so two differently-named tables can silently end up sharing one physical store and mixing their rows.

likelihood: unusual
tradeoffs: Only affects the two mobile plugins, which have no shipped consumers in this repo, and moving them onto the shared naming helper changes the physical store names of any database already written by them.

## Background

Every table in a store-backed database is kept in its own **physical store** — a LevelDB
sublevel, an IndexedDB object store, a SQLite table, depending on which storage plugin is in
use. The logical name of that store is built in one place, `buildDataStoreName` /
`buildIndexStoreName` in `packages/quereus-store/src/common/key-builder.ts`, which produce
`{schema}.{table}` and `{schema}.{table}_idx_{index}`.

Before creating a table or index, `StoreModule.assertStoreNameFree` checks that the name it
is about to use is not already taken. That check compares the names as plain strings. It is
therefore only a real guarantee of "these two tables will not share storage" when the
storage plugin's own translation from that name to its native name is **injective** — that
is, when two different names can never come out the same.

The LevelDB plugin satisfies that: it percent-escapes the name's bytes, so distinct names
stay distinct. The IndexedDB plugin satisfies it: it uses the name verbatim. Two mobile
plugins do not go through the shared helpers at all, and build their own names instead.

## Problem 1 — NativeScript SQLite silently merges tables (the serious one)

`packages/quereus-plugin-nativescript-sqlite/src/provider.ts`:

```ts
private getTableName(schemaName: string, tableName: string): string {
    const sanitized = `${schemaName}_${tableName}`.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]/g, '_');
    return `${this.tablePrefix}${sanitized}`;
}
```

Every character that is not a letter, digit, or underscore becomes `_`. That is a
many-to-one mapping, so distinct tables collapse onto one SQLite table:

| SQL | native SQLite table |
| --- | --- |
| `create table "a-b" (...) using store` | `quereus_main_a_b` |
| `create table "a b" (...) using store` | `quereus_main_a_b` |
| `create table "a.b" (...) using store` | `quereus_main_a_b` |
| `create table "café" (...) using store` | `quereus_main_caf_` |

All of these are legal quoted identifiers in Quereus. Nothing rejects the second `create`:
`assertStoreNameFree` sees the *logical* names `main.a-b` and `main.a b`, which are
different, and passes. The two tables then read and write the same rows. Depending on their
column sets this shows up as corrupted-looking data, spurious primary-key conflicts, or rows
appearing in a table they were never inserted into.

The `_idx_` separator makes it worse in the same way the shared builders already document:
because `_` is also what punctuation folds *to*, an index and a sibling table can land on
the same native name from more directions than they can under LevelDB.

Note this has nothing to do with the earlier unpaired-surrogate work — that guard rejects a
narrow class of malformed name, whereas this folds perfectly ordinary names. It was noticed
while reviewing `bug-store-physical-store-name-lone-surrogate-collision`.

## Problem 2 — React Native LevelDB is inconsistent about index-name case

`packages/quereus-plugin-react-native-leveldb/src/provider.ts` builds
`{prefix}.{schema}.{table}` lowercased for a data store, but for an index store it appends
`_idx_{indexName}` **without** lowercasing the index name:

```ts
const dbName = `${this.getDatabaseName(schemaName, tableName)}${STORE_SUFFIX.INDEX}${indexName}`;
```

The shared builder lowercases the whole thing. SQL identifiers are case-insensitive, so an
index the engine considers to be one object can map to two different on-device databases
here depending on how its name was spelled, and the mapping disagrees with every other
plugin. No known reproduction — this package has no test harness — but it is a divergence
from the canonical naming that will not stay harmless.

## Expected behavior

- Two tables (or indexes) that the engine considers distinct must never share one physical
  store, under any storage plugin. If a plugin's native namespace genuinely cannot represent
  a name, it must **reject** the name rather than fold it onto another one.
- All plugins should derive their physical name from the shared `buildDataStoreName` /
  `buildIndexStoreName` helpers, so the naming rules (lowercasing, the `_idx_` separator, the
  identifier guards) live in one place and every plugin inherits them. A plugin may prefix or
  escape that name; it should not re-derive it.
- Whatever escaping NativeScript SQLite adopts to reach a legal SQLite identifier must be
  reversible-in-principle (e.g. percent-encoding, as the LevelDB plugin does) rather than
  lossy.

## Decision needed before implementing

Changing either plugin's naming **renames existing on-device stores**, so any database
already written by these plugins becomes unreadable unless a migration is provided. Someone
needs to decide whether these plugins have shipped users:

- If not: change the naming outright, no migration.
- If so: either add a one-time rename migration, or keep the current name as a fallback that
  is read when the new name is absent.

## Suggested coverage

Both defects are reachable purely at the name-construction level, so they can be unit-tested
without a device or emulator — construct the provider with a stub database/open function and
assert that two distinct logical names never produce the same native name. Neither package
has a test directory today; adding one for the naming logic alone is cheap.
