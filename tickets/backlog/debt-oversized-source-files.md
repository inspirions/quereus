description: Nine source and test files across the repo have grown well past the size at which this project has previously split a file, and nothing stops the next one from growing the same way; add an automated size limit and work through the backlog of files already over it.

difficulty: medium
tradeoffs: Every one of these files works and none of the splits fixes a defect, so the whole theme is pure churn against a moving target — a maintainer may reasonably decline the ratchet (it will block unrelated PRs) and split individual files only when a ticket has to touch them anyway.

# Nine oversized files, and nothing that stops a tenth

This ticket absorbs nine separately-filed size tickets. They were filed one at a time,
each measured by hand, each arguing the same point — which is itself the evidence that
a **guard** is the deliverable and the splits are the backlog it drains.

The project already applies exactly this pattern to documentation: `scripts/check-docs.mjs`
enforces a per-doc word-count ratchet (a doc may shrink but not grow). There is no
equivalent for source.

## The invariant that retires the class

A source-size ratchet in the same shape as the docs one: a recorded per-file line count
that may shrink but not grow, with a hard ceiling for new files. A file over the ceiling
is recorded at its current size, so the gate goes green immediately and every subsequent
edit either holds or reduces the number. That converts "someone should split this" from a
ticket into a build failure at the moment the file grows.

Open question for whoever picks this up: whether the ceiling is one number repo-wide or
per-package, and whether test files get a higher one (the largest offender here is a spec).

## The backlog it drains

Measurements below are as recorded on each absorbed ticket; re-measure before splitting.

### `packages/quereus/src/vtab/memory/layer/manager.ts` — 3,589 lines

`MemoryTableManager`, one class: committed data, the stack of per-transaction layers,
every secondary index, and every `ALTER TABLE` arm that reshapes any of the above. Named
seams, already barely interacting: transaction/savepoint layer lifecycle (open, collapse,
commit, rollback); primary and secondary index structures and re-keying them; the
`ALTER TABLE` arms (add/drop/rename column, alter column, primary key, add/drop/rename
constraint — each a schema rewrite plus a row migration); constraint enforcement over
existing rows (UNIQUE / CHECK); connection registry bookkeeping.
Measured 2026-08 with `(Get-Content … | Measure-Object -Line).Lines`.
Reference: `packages/quereus/src/vtab/memory/module.ts` (988 lines) drives it.

### `packages/quereus/src/runtime/emit/materialized-view-helpers.ts` — 3,107 lines

The larger of the two emitter offenders. Its internal seams need a look before proposing
a split. (Re-measured 2026-08-03 with `wc -l`; grown since first filing at 3,093.)

### `packages/quereus/src/schema/schema-differ.ts` — 3,013 lines (unit spec 1,186)

Re-measured with `wc -l` on 2026-08-07 (2,725 at first filing); the rename-artifact-tolerant
compare (`absorbRenameArtifacts` and its three per-sink wrappers) is a natural extraction seam
that arrived after the split description below was written. One entry point (`computeSchemaDiff`) plus the DDL
renderer (`generateMigrationDDL`) over several separable responsibilities: rename
resolution (tables, views, indexes, columns, named constraints); per-object-kind diffing
(tables & columns, named constraints, indexes, views & materialized views, assertions);
the logical/lens diff variant; tag-drift detection; migration-DDL emission and its
statement ordering. Each kind's loop follows the same shape (name-match → body compare →
drop+recreate on drift), so the split is mechanical: one module per object kind, a thin
sequencing `computeSchemaDiff`, and the ordering-sensitive `generateMigrationDDL` kept
whole in its own file. The spec splits the same way.

### `packages/quereus/src/runtime/emit/alter-table.ts` — 2,419 lines

Holds the dispatcher for every `ALTER TABLE` verb, the per-verb runners (add/drop/rename
column, alter column, primary key, constraints, tags, the maintained-view lifecycle
verbs), **and** three independent table-rebuild strategies (in-place memory rebuild,
shadow-table rebuild via generated SQL, native-module path). The rebuild strategies are
self-contained and read as their own concern. (Re-measured 2026-08-03; was 2,155.)

### `packages/quereus-isolation/src/isolated-table.ts` — 2,077 lines

Now the largest file in the isolation package and it has had **no** split at all. The
per-connection table handle: merged reads, write routing into the overlay, cross-layer
PK/UNIQUE conflict detection, key ordering and collation resolution, savepoint
bookkeeping.

### `packages/quereus-isolation/src/isolation-module.ts` — 1,825 lines

Down from ~2,845: the `ALTER TABLE` overlay-migration machinery already moved out into
`alter-migration.ts` (1,078 lines) under `debt-isolation-module-alter-migration-extract`.
**Do not redo that work.** What remains mixes module lifecycle and bookkeeping
(create/connect/destroy, the per-connection overlay registry, commit and rollback,
savepoint tracking, renames) with secondary-index DDL forwarding. This is a *separate*
split from `isolated-table.ts` — do not bundle them.

### `scripts/check-docs.mjs` — 1,325 lines

The documentation gate, the first and cheapest step of `yarn check`. Started as a link
checker and accreted a check per ticket: **A** link integrity, **B** invariant format,
**C** doc size ratchet, **D** stability tiers for docs, **E** stability tiers for
packages. Each check is well factored internally (short named functions, per-check
self-tests); the problem is only that all five share one file with a handful of genuinely
common helpers (CRLF/BOM-safe reader, fence stripper, GitHub heading slugifier, package
directory walker). Wanted shape: a `scripts/check-docs/` directory with a thin entry
point, one module per check, plus a shared helpers module.
Blocks: `debt-stability-table-machine-readable` names this split as its prereq, and
`debt-check-docs-validate-section-markers` would add a sixth check to the same file.

### `packages/quoomb-cli/src/commands/dot-commands.ts` — 1,189 lines

Measured with `wc -l` on 2026-08-03. Four unrelated responsibilities behind one
`handleDotCommand` / `DotCommands` pair: CSV import/export (papaparse, file I/O);
result-table rendering and output-mode switches; schema introspection commands
(`.tables`, `.schema`, …); and the entire plugin manager — the `~/.quoomb/plugins.json`
record store (`loadPlugins`/`savePlugins`), install/remove/enable/disable/reload/config,
and the hash-pinning commands (`pin`, `unpin`, `trust`).

The plugin half alone is roughly half the file and is where all recent work has landed:
`feat-plugin-loader-hash-pinning`, `feat-cli-plugin-pinning` and
`feat-config-declared-plugin-hashes` each edited it and each had to read past the CSV and
formatting code. `bug-cli-corrupt-plugins-file-silently-wipes-plugins` (still open)
targets the record store inside the same file. Its plugin-side suite,
`packages/quoomb-cli/test/plugin-commands.spec.ts`, splits the same way.

### `packages/quereus-store/src/common/store-table-base.ts` (1,033) and `store-table-scan.ts` (1,023)

These two have a **documented** threshold, not an invented one. `docs/store.md` records:

> NOTE: the two largest `StoreTable` layers sit near 900 lines each. If either passes
> ~1,000, split it the same way — the scan layer's natural next seam is the multi-seek
> group (`decodeMultiSeekTuples` / `orderTupleValues` / `scanMultiSeek` /
> `scanMultiSeekPrimary`), and the base's is the statistics block.

Both have passed it. Full chain measured with `wc -l` from `packages/quereus-store`:
1,023 `store-table-scan.ts`, 1,033 `store-table-base.ts`, 711 `store-table-constraints.ts`,
722 `store-table.ts`. The doc already names the seam for each file, so this is mechanical.

### `packages/quereus-store/src/common/store-table.ts` — `update()` is ~315 lines

Not a whole-file split: one method. `update()` is the single entry point the engine calls
for every row write against a store-backed table — one `switch (operation)` with three
arms written inline (`insert` ~125 lines, `update` ~130, `delete` ~45, lines ~252-565),
roughly half of the 645-line file and the largest method in the package. `AGENTS.md` asks
for small single-purpose methods and decomposed sub-functions in preference to long blocks
separated by comments. Pre-existing debt: the file was recently reduced from ~3,400 lines
to 645 by the four-file `StoreTable` chain split, which was a pure move.

### `packages/quereus-isolation/test/isolation-layer.spec.ts` — 6,860 lines

The largest file in the theme, and a test. An order of magnitude larger than every sibling
in the folder (`alter-table-conformance.spec.ts`, `merge-iterator.spec.ts`,
`key-set-seek-merge.spec.ts`, `flush-probe-ordering.spec.ts`, … all a few hundred lines).
Everything under one `describe('IsolationModule')` with dozens of nested blocks: table
creation, reads/writes, savepoints, commit/rollback, every ALTER arm, cross-connection
overlay behavior, poisoning, concurrency modes.

Nothing is broken; the cost is navigational, and it is already compounding — several
near-duplicate local test modules (subclasses of `IsolationModule`, fake
`VirtualTableModule`s) exist in the file because their authors did not find the earlier
one. Split by behavior under test, keeping shared helpers in one importable place rather
than copied per file.

## Notes for whoever picks this up

- The ratchet and the splits are separable, and the ratchet is the part worth promoting
  first: without it this ticket regrows.
- The splits are not one unit of work. Each is independently promotable and several are
  purely mechanical; `store-table-scan.ts` / `store-table-base.ts` have their seams named
  in `docs/store.md` and `schema-differ.ts` has a stated per-object-kind cut.
- `scripts/check-docs.mjs` has a downstream dependent (`debt-stability-table-machine-readable`),
  so promote that one ahead of the rest if the theme is split.
