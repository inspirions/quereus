 * and that one is inert on a relay — no `getTableSchema` oracle to tell it which
 * held tables are back, so it returns 0. `evictExpiredBasisTables` is likewise
 * inert without a `dropLocalTable` callback. What actually reclaims here is
 * `pruneTombstones` / `pruneQuarantine` — both at horizon granularity (default 30
 * days) — plus `repairChangeLog`, which needs neither oracle nor callback and so
 * does real work on a relay too. Hourly expires records well inside the horizon
 * while costing nothing when there is nothing to reclaim (every sweep is
 * zero-cost on an empty scan).
 * A documented constant rather than a `CoordinatorConfig` knob,
 * matching the other internal timings in this package (store idle timeout,
 * cleanup interval); promote it to config only if a deployment needs to tune it.
