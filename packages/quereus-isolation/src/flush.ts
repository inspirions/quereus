/**
 * Applies every staged overlay row to the underlying table WITHOUT committing.
 *
 * This is the *apply-only* half of the isolation commit flush. It begins a
 * transaction on the underlying table and writes each overlay entry (tombstones
 * as deletes, live rows as insert/update), but deliberately leaves the
 * underlying transaction OPEN. Committing per table here is exactly what tears a
 * multi-table commit (table A durably commits before table B applies), so the
 * commit is factored out to {@link IsolationModule.commitConnectionOverlays},
 * which drives one apply-all pass followed by one commit-all pass across every
 * table the db-transaction touched.
 *
 * Preserves the original per-table flush semantics:
 * - Deletes (tombstones) are applied before inserts/updates so a write colliding
 *   on a secondary UNIQUE with a row being deleted in the same flush sees the
 *   slot freed first. Each PK appears at most once in the overlay, so there is no
 *   same-PK delete-then-insert pair this reordering could invert; sort() is
 *   stable in V8/Node, preserving the original PK order within each group.
 * - Data writes use `preCoerced`/`trustedWrite` (the overlay already coerced and
 *   constraint-checked them in the merged view).
 * - A post-precheck constraint result is a loud INTERNAL error (see
 *   {@link assertFlushWriteOk}), never silently dropped.
