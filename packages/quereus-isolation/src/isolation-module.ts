	 * applied, so a failure in B leaves A committed. See the fix ticket and
	 * `quereus-store/README` § "Atomic multi-store commit".
	 *
	 * Phase 1 (apply): for every staged overlay, begin its underlying table and
	 * apply the overlay's rows WITHOUT committing (see {@link applyOverlayToUnderlying}).
	 * For a `quereus-store` underlying, every table's writes accumulate in the
	 * module's single shared coordinator (the first `begin()` opens it; the rest are
	 * idempotent no-ops).
	 *
	 * Phase 2 (commit): once ALL overlays have applied, commit the affected
	 * underlying tables. For `quereus-store` the first `commit()` flushes every
	 * table's ops in one atomic coordinator commit — a single `AtomicBatch.write()`
	 * on a provider that exposes `beginAtomicBatch` — and the rest no-op. For an
	 * underlying with per-table transaction domains (the memory vtab), each table
	 * commits independently.
	 *
	 * On any Phase-1 error, roll back every underlying begun so far and rethrow;
	 * nothing was committed, so the transaction aborts atomically. Because all the
	 * fallible data work (constraint re-checks, injected/IO write errors) happens in
	 * Phase 1 before any commit, a data-driven abort is always clean. Full
	 * crash-atomicity across the commit phase itself is contingent on the underlying
	 * exposing a shared atomic commit domain (see docs/design-isolation-layer.md
	 * § "Commit Failure Recovery").
	 *
	 * A poisoned overlay aborts the whole commit before any apply — mirroring the
	 * per-connection `assertOverlayUsable` check, now with the added benefit that no earlier
	 * table is left committed. The overlay is left intact so the ensuing rollback discards
	 * it. Two DDLs poison: a cross-connection ALTER (rows left in the pre-alter layout) and
	 * a cross-connection DROP TABLE (the table is gone; see {@link destroy}).
	 *
	 * Driven once per db-transaction: the first `IsolatedConnection.commit()` in the
	 * database's commit loop runs this whole flush and clears every overlay, so the
	 * remaining connections find no overlay for their table and this is a no-op — no
	 * explicit "already flushed" latch is needed, the cleared-overlay state guards
	 * itself.
	 *
	 * **Invariant: every staged overlay resolves to an underlying table here, or is
	 * poisoned.** The table-lifecycle hooks are what keep that true — {@link destroy}
	 * discards or poisons the overlays of a dropped table across every connection, and
	 * {@link renameTable} re-connects the underlying under the new name whenever it re-keys
	 * an overlay onto it. The poison check above is the enforcement point: it runs BEFORE
	 * the `underlyingTables` lookup, so a dropped table's surviving foreign overlay raises
	 * its poison message rather than the orphan error below. A miss that is neither resolved
	 * nor poisoned is therefore a layer-invariant violation, not a routine condition, and is
	 * raised as `StatusCode.INTERNAL`: the alternative — dropping the staged rows and letting
	 * the commit report success — is silent data loss. Only a CLEAN overlay

	 * handle stays untouched in both directions.
	 *
	 * "Dedicated" is what this asks of the underlying, not what it can guarantee: a module
	 * whose `connect` re-serves a cached instance per table key (`StoreModule` does) hands
	 * back the writer's object anyway. That is precisely why {@link readCommittedSnapshot}
	 * mirrors the underlying instead of claiming safety unconditionally.
	 *
	 * **Why a fresh handle per committed read, rather than sharing the memoized one.**
	 * The memoized handle is the WRITER's: `commitConnectionOverlays` flushes staged rows
	 * through it incrementally (Phase 1 begins the underlying and applies row by row;
	 * Phase 2 commits), so a read delegating to it between the phases observes a partially
	 * applied batch — defeating the underlying's own atomic commit one level up.
	 *
	 * **Why it is not memoized alongside the writer handle either.** A `_readCommitted`
	 * `MemoryTable` pins its read layer at the first scan pull and serves that layer for
	 * the life of the instance (`MemoryTable.ensureConnection`, the `readCommitted` arm).
	 * A handle memoized for the table's lifetime would therefore serve the SAME committed
	 * state forever, going arbitrarily stale, and would hold the layer chain against
	 * collapse (`MemoryTableManager.isLayerInUse` walks the connection's `readLayer` chain)
	 * for as long as the table exists. A stale-forever snapshot is worse than the tear.
	 * Not memoizing also keeps `destroy`/`renameTable`/the attach seams free of a second
	 * eviction: nothing new ever lands in `underlyingTables`.
	 *
	 * The per-read connect is cheap for both in-tree underlyings — `MemoryTableModule.connect`
	 * is a map lookup plus a `new MemoryTable(...)` (the manager connection and layer pin
	 * happen later, at the first scan pull), and `StoreModule.connect` returns its own
	 * memoized `StoreTable` on a map hit. Neither performs I/O per committed read. An
	 * out-of-tree underlying with an expensive `connect` pays it per committed read, which
	 * is the accepted cost of not freezing the snapshot.
	 *
	 * The handle is released by {@link IsolatedTable.disconnect} — required on the memory
	 * path, where disconnect is what drops the pinned read layer's collapse protection.

	 *
	 * - **The dropping connection's own overlay** is discarded silently. It issued the DROP;
	 *   there is nobody to notify.
	 * - **A foreign overlay with staged rows** (`hasChanges`) is **poisoned**, not swept.
	 *   Sweeping it let that connection commit against an empty overlay set and report
	 *   success after its rows were thrown away — silent cross-connection data loss. Poison
	 *   makes its next read/write/commit throw `CONSTRAINT` (see
	 *   {@link IsolatedTable.assertOverlayUsable} and the poison check at the head of
	 *   {@link commitConnectionOverlays}, which precedes the `underlyingTables` lookup and so
	 *   raises the poison message rather than the orphan INTERNAL error). An already-poisoned
	 *   overlay keeps its original message — the first cause is the one worth reporting.
	 * - **A foreign overlay with no staged rows** is discarded: it staged nothing, so nothing
	 *   is lost.
	 *
	 * `preOverlaySavepoints` is swept for every matching key whose overlay did NOT survive.
	 * A surviving poisoned overlay keeps its set: `ensureOverlay` padding still consults it,
	 * and the owning connection's `onConnectionRollback` reaps it when its failed commit
	 * rolls back. Without the sweep, an abandoned set outlived the table for the lifetime of
	 * the `Database` (nothing else is keyed to reap it once the table is gone).
	 *
	 * Nothing is discarded or poisoned until the underlying destroy SUCCEEDS. A throwing
	 * `underlying.destroy` means the table still exists, so every connection's staged
	 * writes are still flushable and every map entry must survive untouched — the same
	 * reason {@link renameTable} delegates before mutating its maps.
	 *
	 * NOTE: poison rides on the `ConnectionOverlayState`, not on its rows, so a foreign
	 * connection that later unwinds every staged row past the drop (rollback to a savepoint
	 * taken after the overlay existed) still fails its commit. Deliberately over-strict —
	 * the table is gone either way. If a caller ever needs the clean-unwind case to commit,
	 * re-evaluate the poison on `onConnectionRollbackToSavepoint` rather than special-casing
	 * here.
	 *
	 * NOTE: a connection whose own overlay was already poisoned (by another connection's
	 * ALTER) escapes that poison for this table by dropping it — the own-overlay branch
	 * deletes the state, poison and all. Correct as written: the rows it discards belong to
	 * a table this connection just asked to remove. If poison ever carries a cause that
	 * outlives the table, gate the own-overlay delete on it.
	 *
	 * NOTE: this mutates `connectionOverlays` while a foreign connection may be mid-scan in
	 * `IsolatedTable.query`'s merged branch — that scan will keep merging against an overlay
	 * whose underlying is now destroyed. The module clamps to `'reentrant-reads'`, so no

	 * underlying, the schema catalog, and every overlay are still untouched, so the
	 * ALTER either fails clean or fully applies — base/catalog can no longer diverge.
	 * This mirrors the engine's pre-mutation `validateNotNullBackfill` in

	 *
	 * **Row-content validation.** The row-validating arms (`add constraint … unique`,

	 * Every copied secondary index — and every copied UNIQUE constraint, including the ones
	 * a UNIQUE index derives — is narrowed to a PARTIAL structure over live rows only
	 * (`<tombstone> = 0`), AND-ed onto whatever partial predicate it already carried. A
	 * tombstone is a deletion marker, not a row, so no uniqueness rule may be evaluated over
	 * it: it carries its row's PK and NULL everywhere else, so a UNIQUE structure whose
	 * columns all sit inside the PK would otherwise see two deleted rows as duplicates.
	 * (Non-PK unique columns escaped only because their tombstone key is NULL and SQL treats
	 * NULLs as distinct.) The overlay's PRIMARY KEY uniqueness is NOT narrowed — it must keep
	 * covering tombstones so a re-insert at a tombstoned PK is detected and converted.
	 *
	 * `IsolatedTable.mergedSecondaryIndexQuery` wants exactly the live overlay rows out of
	 * these indexes, so narrowing them is what it already expects.
	 *
	 * NOTE: a base column already named {@link tombstoneColumn} lands here as a SECOND column
	 * of that name, and `columnIndexMap` resolves the name to the appended flag. Harmless
	 * today — every consumer reaches the flag by index, and reads, merged scans, a unique
	 * secondary index over that column and a staged deletion all behave exactly as they do
	 * for a non-colliding name. If anything ever resolves the overlay's columns BY NAME (a
	 * hand-built overlay predicate, a module that re-derives its own index map from the
	 * column list), give the overlay a collision-free flag name here instead. ALTER into the
	 * name is rejected outright — see {@link assertColumnNameNotTombstone} for why that one
