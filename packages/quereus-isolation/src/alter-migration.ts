/**
 * Carrying a connection's open staging area (its "overlay") forward across an ALTER TABLE.
 *
 * When one connection runs ALTER TABLE, the shared underlying table mutates immediately and
 * irreversibly. Every open overlay therefore has to be judged BEFORE that mutation and then
 * reshaped to match it, or else marked unusable ("poisoned") for its owning connection. This
 * module owns that whole subject; `IsolationModule.alterTable` is its only caller and stays
 * responsible for the surrounding lifecycle — which overlays are in scope, how a failure is
 * routed (issuer vs foreign), and the ALTER PRIMARY KEY overlay swap.
 *
 * The flow, in the order `alterTable` runs it:
 *
 * 1. {@link assertColumnNameNotTombstone} — reject a column name that would collide with the
 *    overlay's private deletion-marker flag, before anything mutates.
 * 2. {@link deriveAlterMigrationPlan} — precompute every per-change-type constant the later
 *    passes need, from the PRE-alter schema (so it is valid before the underlying mutates).
 * 3. {@link validateOverlayMigration} — dry-run one overlay's fallible work without mutating
 *    it. Runs for the issuer before `underlying.alterTable` (atomic abort) and per foreign
 *    overlay after it (a data rejection becomes poison, via {@link buildAlterPoisonMessage}).
 * 4. {@link planPkRekeyMarkerDrops} / {@link applyPkRekeyMarkerDrops} /
 *    {@link reinsertPkRekeyMarkers} — the primary-key re-key marker handling, which the issuer
 *    path also needs BEFORE the underlying mutates so the overlay's own `alterSchema` can be
 *    pre-flighted against the exact state the migrate step will see.
 * 5. {@link migrateOverlayForward} — reshape one overlay to the post-alter schema, in place.

 * re-key collapses onto another staged row are discarded first
 * ({@link dropCollapsedPkRekeyMarkers}) — the overlay's PK deliberately covers markers, so
 * without the drop its own `alterSchema` would reject the collapsed pair as a PK collision.
 *
 * Neither NOT NULL direction forwards, and the overlay's `notNull` flag is left where it
 * stood when the overlay was created:
 *
 * - **Tightening (`set not null`).** Forwarding would have the overlay module tighten a
 *   column whose tombstone rows carry NULL at every non-PK data column, so it would either
 *   backfill a deletion marker's placeholder NULL from the DEFAULT (corrupting a row that
 *   is not a row) or reject it outright when no usable DEFAULT exists. The base's NOT NULL
 *   is enforced where it belongs — by the underlying over the issuer's effective rows, and
 *   per overlay by {@link validateOverlayMigration} — and the staged LIVE rows' NULLs are
 *   filled here via {@link backfillStagedNotNull}.
 * - **Relaxing (`drop not null`).** Nothing to do: the overlay never enforced the flag, and
 *   the rows it stages are written with `preCoerced: true` through the overlay module's own
 *   write path, which does not consult column nullability at all.
 *
 * NOTE: both directions therefore leave the overlay's `notNull` flag drifted from the base
 * for the rest of the transaction. Inert today — nothing on the overlay path reads it. The
 * one consumer that would, `MemoryTableModule.getBestAccessPlan` (which prunes `IS NULL` on
 * a NOT NULL column to an empty result), is unreachable because the isolation layer builds
 * the overlay's `FilterInfo` itself (see `filter-info.ts`) instead of planning against the
 * overlay module. If overlay scans ever route through the overlay module's planner hook, or
 * its write path starts enforcing nullability, this has to become a real forward that
 * excludes tombstones.
 *
 * The runtime admits exactly one attribute per ALTER COLUMN, so a `setNotNull` change
 * carries nothing else to forward. A missing overlay `alterSchema` is a no-op, as in
