/**
 * Runs the shared KVStore conformance suite against the React Native LevelDB backend.
 *
 * The suite lives in `@quereus/store/testing` (built to dist — run the store build, or
 * `yarn build`, before this spec so the import resolves).
 *
 * The real rn-leveldb bindings are a native module that cannot load under Node, so the
 * backend under test is the store driving `MockLevelDB` (see `test/mock-leveldb.ts` for
 * why that mock is written to be a faithful LevelDB rather than a convenient map).
 *
 * The mock keeps nothing outside the process, so this adapter supplies no `reopen` and
 * the persistence tier is not registered for this backend — same as the in-memory store.
 * Real on-device persistence is LevelDB's own and is not exercised here.
