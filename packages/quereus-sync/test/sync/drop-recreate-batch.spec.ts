/**
 * A batch that DROPS a table and RE-CREATES it under the same name must leave the
 * receiver holding the new incarnation's rows, in the table, in that same apply.
 *
 * The failure this pins: unknown-table detection used to reduce the batch's schema
 * steps to two order-blind sets (`created` / `dropped`) and call a table absent when it
 * appeared in both. A `create → drop → create` batch put the table in both sets, so
 * every row for it was diverted as "belongs to a table I do not have" — even though the
 * same batch's schema steps, replayed in timestamp order, leave the table present and
 * empty, ready for exactly those rows. With the default `quarantine` disposition the
 * rows were held and only surfaced on the next maintenance sweep (a convergence delay);
 * with `ignore` they were lost permanently. `change-applicator.ts` now derives one
 * per-table verdict (`computeBatchTableFates`) and reads it at all three sites: the
 * row-admission gate, `freshLocalTable`, and the reactive drain.
 *
 * The verdict is a SIMULATION of what the receiver will do, not a reading of the batch's
 * schema steps in isolation: it seeds each mentioned name with whether the receiver has it
 * now and replays only the migrations Phase 1a KEPT. The second top-level describe below
 * pins the seeding half — a `create_table` the receiver already processed and has since
 * undone locally must not resurrect the table in the prediction.
 *
 * The `freshLocalTable` half of the verdict tracks table IDENTITY, not the name: read-free
 * resolution skips the LWW comparison, so it is reserved for a name whose stranded
 * bookkeeping belongs to some other table. A re-delivered batch changes no local schema,
 * and a name renamed away and back gets its own table returned to it; both resolve
 * normally.
 *
 * Every spec here runs on real `Database` peers (`_peer-harness.ts`), so it asserts what
 * `select` returns, not what the metadata believes.
