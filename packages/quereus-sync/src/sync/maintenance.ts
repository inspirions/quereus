/**

 * sweeps (`drainHeldChanges` / `pruneQuarantine` / `pruneTombstones` /
 * `repairChangeLog` / `evictExpiredBasisTables`) but never schedules them — the host owns cadence
 * (`docs/sync.md` § Who drives the sweep, `docs/migration.md` § 4 Contract).
 * What lives here is only the *shape* of one pass — ordering, error isolation,
 * single-flight — with no timer and no `SyncManager` import, so every host
 * (browser worker, relay coordinator, native app) runs the same semantics
 * instead of re-deriving them. Arming a timer around `createSyncMaintenanceTicker`
 * stays the host's job.

 * Default cadence for a host's sync-maintenance loop (5 minutes).
 *
 * The latency-sensitive sweep is `drainHeldChanges` (held edits replay within
 * one interval once a table reappears); prune/evict act only at horizon
 * granularity (default 30 days) so are latency-insensitive. Every sweep is
 * zero-cost when nothing is held/expired, so minutes is ample. A host with no
 * latency-sensitive sweep (a relay, where `drainHeldChanges` is inert) is free
 * to pick a slower cadence of its own.

 *
 * Note the collapsed tick *does not* join the in-flight pass — it resolves
