/**
 * Stage the deletion of every column version of a row, together with the
 * change-log entries that index them, into the caller's `batch`. The caller
 * owns the write — nothing is committed here.
 *
 * The `cl:` change log is a derived HLC-ordered index over live `cv:`/`tb:`
 * records: `collectChangesSince` resolves each entry back to its record and drops
 * the entry when that record is gone. So once a row's column versions are deleted,
 * their `cl:` entries can never produce output again — they are pure garbage that
 * still costs a KV lookup per delta scan. Deleting them with their target is what
 * keeps the change log proportional to LIVE data instead of to the replica's
 * lifetime delete volume.
 *
 * Both stores' deletions share the one `WriteBatch`, so no crash can leave the
 * index and the data disagreeing.
 *
 * Used by both delete paths — local DML capture (`recordDataEvent`) and inbound
 * apply (`commitChangeMetadata`) — which must stay symmetric: a relay runs almost
 * exclusively the latter.
 *
 * `keepColumns` names columns whose cell record must SURVIVE this cleanup: on the
 * inbound path, a column write in the same apply batch that beat the delete under
 * `allowResurrection` (see change-applicator's `reconcileInBatchDeletes`). The scan
 * reads committed storage, which by cleanup time already includes those records —
 * both the `cv:` delete and its paired `cl:` delete skip them. Empty/absent for
 * every caller unless resurrection is on.
 *
 * `staged` is the local-capture path's read-your-own-writes overlay state for
 * the row (see `staged-transaction-metadata.ts`): the committed scan cannot see
 * cell records the transaction has only STAGED into `batch`, so the column set
 * here is (committed scan) ∪ (staged live columns), each `cl:` removal keyed by
 * the staged HLC where one exists (the committed entry's removal was already
 * staged when the cell was rewritten). A cleared row's committed columns not
 * re-staged since are skipped — the clear that set `rowCleared` staged their
 * removals already. Absent on the inbound path, whose batch is committed before
 * cleanup runs.
