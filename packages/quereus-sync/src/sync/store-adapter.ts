/**
 * Store adapter for applying remote sync changes.
 *
 * Implements the ApplyToStoreCallback interface over the store module's
 * external row-write entry point (`StoreTable.applyExternalRowChanges` —
 * table-owned key encoding, secondary-index and stats maintenance) plus the
 * engine's batch ingestion seam (`Database.ingestExternalRowChanges` — change
 * capture for `Database.watch` + global assertions, materialized-view
 * maintenance, opt-in parent-side FK actions).
 *
 * Per `applyToStore(dataChanges, schemaChanges, options)` invocation:
 *   1. Schema changes execute first via `db.exec` (DDL before DML), with the
 *      resulting module schema events pre-marked remote. Replicated DDL is
 *      applied IDEMPOTENTLY: an object already in the migration's wanted state
 *      with a matching definition is counted applied without re-exec'ing, so two
 *      peers that independently created the same table converge instead of the
 *      receiver failing "already exists" on every sync (see
 *      {@link decideSchemaChange}).
 *   2. Data changes are grouped per table, then per row; each row group
 *      collapses to ONE `ExternalRowOp` — the group's NET effect in list
 *      order, which the caller delivers HLC-ordered (a delete resets the row to
 *      absent and later column updates rebuild it from PK+nulls; updates with no
 *      later delete merge onto the pre-read existing row — UPSERT semantics; see
 *      {@link buildRowOp}).
 *   3. `StoreTable.applyExternalRowChanges(ops)` applies the table's ops to
 *      committed storage and returns the EFFECTIVE changes (no-ops — absent
 *      delete, value-identical upsert — are suppressed: no storage write, no
 *      module event, no seam report).
 *   4. Module data events are emitted from the effective changes with
 *      `remote: true` (so the SyncManager never re-records inbound changes),
 *      carrying accurate `oldRow` before-images and derived `changedColumns`.
 *   5. After all tables' storage writes, ONE seam call reports the
 *      accumulated effective changes: `db.ingestExternalRowChanges(batch,
 *      { applyForeignKeyActions, assertionFailureMode: 'report' })` — capture +
 *      MV facets default on, commit-time global assertions in REPORT mode (a
 *      violation is collected into the result and the batch still commits).
 *      Changes recorded in `result.errors` are excluded from the batch.
 *
 * Snapshot bootstrap (per-call, not sticky): a known-complete wholesale load
 * defers MV maintenance and watch capture for the whole transfer and converges
 * once at the end.
 *   - `bootstrap` flush: steps 1–4 run unchanged (storage rows applied, remote
 *     module events emitted) but step 5 — the seam call — is SKIPPED. MV
 *     maintenance + capture are deferred to the finalize and FK actions are off
 *     for a wholesale load, so the only seam facet skipping the call drops
 *     outright is commit-time GLOBAL ASSERTION evaluation over the bootstrapped
 *     rows — deliberate under the seam's trust-the-origin contract. The
 *     incremental path enforces global assertions because it **merges** deltas
 *     from possibly many origins into the receiver's existing state, and a
 *     cross-origin merge can produce a global-invariant violation no single
 *     origin ever saw. Bootstrap does something different: it installs **one**
 *     origin's already-converged state **wholesale (replace, not merge)** — no
 *     merge means no merge-introduced violation, so a complete snapshot already
 *     satisfied the origin's assertions and re-checking is redundant. The
 *     `bootstrapFinalize` therefore does NOT evaluate any global assertion —
 *     not even a no-dependency one. This uniform skip is consistent with the
 *     seam's general trust-the-origin posture for every other constraint type
 *     (see `docs/mv-ingestion.md` § Trust boundary). MV-backed assertions
 *     would see the MV only after `refreshAllMaterializedViews()`; under
 *     trust-the-origin they are not evaluated at finalize at all, so MV-refresh
 *     ordering is moot for assertions. Residual risk (a corrupt/hostile snapshot
 *     installs invariant-violating data) is already unguarded for every other
 *     constraint type; a one-off assertion sweep would be inconsistent
 *     defense-in-depth — a separate integrity layer is the right fix if origins
 *     are ever distrusted. Per-flush evaluation also could not serve bootstrap
 *     correctly: it could spuriously fail a valid snapshot whose cross-table
 *     assertion sees children before parents. The remaining seam work for a
 *     wholesale load is otherwise deferred, so skipping the call also removes
 *     the per-flush transaction/savepoint and the per-flush full-rebuild.
 *   - `bootstrapFinalize` call (empty data/schema): converges every MV in
 *     dependency order via `db.refreshAllMaterializedViews()`, then fires a
 *     coarse `db.notifyExternalChange` per bootstrapped base table and per
 *     refreshed MV — one whole-table watch invalidation instead of per-row
 *     capture. The caller issues it before clearing the snapshot checkpoint, so
 *     a finalize throw leaves the checkpoint in place and the transfer retries.
 *
 * Inbound assertion violations are DETECT-AND-NOTIFY, not throw. Under the
 * seam's trust-the-origin contract the merged data must land regardless, so a
 * **local** commit-time global assertion can only usefully *notify*: the seam
 * runs in report mode, so a violation is collected and RETURNED in
 * `result.assertionViolations` while the batch commits — the derived effects
 * (MV backing deltas, capture entries) for the violating row land on the FIRST
 * attempt, so an incremental MV / `Database.watch` subscriber stays consistent
 * with the base table and there is no divergence and no retry. The consumer
 * (admission.ts) surfaces each returned violation to the host as an
 * `onAssertionViolation` event; the host decides policy.
 *
 * A genuine per-change STORAGE failure is different and still aborts: the
 * adapter collects it in `result.errors` (it keeps applying other tables), and
 * the consumer treats any non-empty `errors` like a whole-batch throw — emit
 * `status:'error'`, leave CRDT metadata uncommitted, re-resolve next sync.
 * Re-application is idempotent (value-identical upserts suppress). "Orthogonal"
 * (above) means the two outcomes are independent facts, NOT that a co-occurring
 * violation is dropped: when ONE batch carries both a per-change error and a
 * reported violation, the violation's row already committed in report mode, so
 * the consumer surfaces the `onAssertionViolation` event BEFORE the per-change
 * abort throws (see admission.ts `applyDataToStore`). The abort still blocks the
 * metadata commit and the batch still re-resolves.
 *
 * Constraints (see docs/mv-ingestion.md § External row-change
 * ingestion): the callback is host-driven — never invoke it from within
 * statement execution or vtab callbacks (exec-mutex deadlock), and hosts
 * should not drive it while holding an open explicit transaction on `db`
 * (the seam would join that transaction, so a later rollback diverges
 * MV/capture state from the already-committed storage rows; recoverable via
 * MV refresh).
