 * SIMULATED: seed each mentioned name with whether the receiver has it NOW
 * (`isPresentLocally`), then replay the three existence-changing migration kinds in
 * HLC order — `migrations` arrives already ordered by {@link orderMigrationsByHLC},
 * the same order Phase 2 replays them in — applying the same decision each kind's
 * {@link decideSchemaChange} arm will reach against the catalog.
 *
 * Both halves of that are load-bearing:
 *
 * - Seeding from local presence is what keeps this verdict and the catalog-based one
 *   in `decideRenameTable` from disagreeing. A `rename_table` moves the name only when
 *   the receiver still HAS the old one; a rename it declines (the old name was dropped
 *   here, or `fromTable` is missing) leaves the new name as absent as it really will
 *   be, so the batch's rows for that name take the normal unknown-table route instead
 *   of reaching a table that does not exist and throwing the whole batch away.
 * - Replaying only the KEPT migrations (Phase 1a drops the HLC-dominated ones) is what
 *   makes the seed meaningful: a dominated migration means the receiver already
 *   processed that fact, so its effect — and anything it did LATER, like dropping the
 *   table again — is already in the seeded presence. Replaying it a second time would
 *   resurrect a state the receiver has since moved past.
 *
 * The simulation tracks WHICH table ends up at each name, not merely whether one does:
 * {@link BatchTableFate.historyName} follows the table, the sync bookkeeping does not.
 * That is what separates the two ways a name is vacated and refilled — a `drop_table`
 * destroys its occupant, so anything arriving afterwards is a stranger to the
 * bookkeeping left behind, while a rename-away followed by a rename BACK returns the
 * very table the bookkeeping describes.

 * Replay held out-of-basis changes (`quarantine` + forwardable `store-and-forward`
 * entries) into tables that have since reappeared in the local basis — the revival
 * half of the unknown-table contract (`docs/migration.md` § 4 Contract). The
 * sibling of {@link applyChanges}' data branch, minus the schema-migration and
 * unknown-table-divert machinery: held changes have no DDL and their table is, by
 * the basis gate, already present.
 *
 * Driven two ways, never interleaved: the host calls {@link SyncManager.drainHeldChanges}
 * from its periodic maintenance sweep, and {@link drainReappearedTables} calls it
 * reactively from {@link applyChanges} the moment an inbound `create_table` revives a
 * held table (gated by {@link SyncConfig.drainOnReappear}). Either way drain runs as a
 * SEPARATE apply, after any re-creating batch has fully committed — fresh data is
 * already in storage and the older held changes simply LWW-resolve against it. The
 * invariant is "never INTERLEAVE drain into the admitting batch", not "never drain
 * inline": a reactive post-commit drain is its own admission unit, distinct from the
 * batch it follows.
 *
 * Scope mirrors {@link QuarantineStore.list}: `(schema, table)` drains one table,
 * `(schema)` drains a schema, `()` sweeps every held entry whose table is back.
 * Bounded by the held set (itself bounded by the retention horizon); zero-cost when
 * nothing is held. With NO basis oracle every group's table reports `undefined`
 * column names ⇒ every group is skipped ⇒ this returns 0 (the relay-only no-op).
