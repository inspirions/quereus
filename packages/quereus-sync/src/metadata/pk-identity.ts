/**
 * Per-table pk-identity keying resolution.
 *
 * The sync layer files every per-row record (`cv:`/`tb:`/`cl:`) under the row's
 * IDENTITY — the same "same row?" answer the rest of the engine gives: each pk
 * column normalized under its KEY COLLATION ('apple' ≡ 'APPLE' under nocase) and
 * its logical type's semantic key transform ('PT1H' ≡ 'PT60M' for TIMESPAN). This
 * module resolves that keying from a table's schema by calling into
 * `@quereus/quereus`'s `resolvePkIdentityKeying` — the ONE implementation of that
 * recipe, also used by `makePkKeySerializer` in `@quereus/isolation` (the overlay's
 * row-alignment key) — so the two layers can never disagree on row identity.
 *
 * Identity is derived and lossy; the row's ADDRESS (a real, type-valid
 * `SqlValue[]` — any spelling from the equivalence class) lives in the record
 * value and on the wire. See docs/sync.md § Row identity vs. address.

 *   everything already filed the moment the schema appears. (The apply path
 *   never reaches here for an out-of-basis table — those changes are diverted
 *   to quarantine, whose keys use the raw encoding, before any keying lookup.)
