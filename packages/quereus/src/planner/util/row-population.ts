/**
 * Row-population predicates.
 *
 * Answers one question: are the rows a node emits *the same rows* its source
 * relation holds, or a different population entirely? Two callers need it —
 * `column-origins.ts` (which attribute ids describe a base-table column) and
 * `key-utils.ts`'s `extractRowSourceTableSchema` (whose statistics describe the
 * rows arriving here) — and they must not drift apart.
 *
 * Decided by `nodeType` rather than `instanceof`: `plan-node-type.ts` is a leaf
 * module, so importing it cannot introduce a cycle into `key-utils.ts` (which is
 * imported from deep inside the node layer).
 *
 * NOTE: `Distinct` is deliberately NOT here. Its output rows are a *subset* of
 * its source's rows, not a different population, so a base-table row fraction
 * stays a defensible approximation. If a filter over a `distinct` ever shows a
 * bad estimate, the reason is a heavily-skewed column — the fraction of *rows*
 * matching a predicate and the fraction of *distinct rows* matching it diverge
 * when values repeat unevenly — and `Distinct` should join `isRowRegrouping`.
 * `LimitOffset`, `OrdinalSlice` and the physical access nodes are excluded for
 * the same reason: subsets, not different populations.
