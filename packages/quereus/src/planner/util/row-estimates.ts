/**
 * Row-estimate plumbing shared by `computePhysical` implementations.

 * A relational node carries two row counts:

 *    and derived from the *logical* children;
 *  - the PHYSICAL one, `physical.estimatedRows`, folded bottom-up during the
 *    Physical pass from the children's already-computed physical properties.
 *
 * The two diverge the moment the optimizer replaces a `Retrieve` subtree with a
 * physical access node (`SeqScan` / `IndexScan` / `IndexSeek`): those declare no
 * `estimatedRows` getter, so every logical getter reading through them yields
 * `undefined` while their physical property holds the real catalog-derived count.
 * A `computePhysical` that estimates from `this.source.estimatedRows` therefore
 * silently loses the count for the rest of the plan.

// much further than it used to: before this relay it died at the first operator that
// read a logical getter, and consumers fell back to their own defaults instead. Any
// consumer that reads a row estimate as a *magnitude* must therefore spell 0 as
// unknown — `rule-cte-optimization` gates on `sourceSize > 0` and had to be taught
// this (its `|| defaultRowEstimate` matches `vtab/memory/module.ts`); threshold
// consumers that floor (the cache threshold's min of 1000) or use a `>` test are
// unaffected. The real fix is distinguishing unknown from empty at the source —
// not clamping here, which would erase a genuinely empty analyzed table.
