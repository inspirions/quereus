/**
 * Rule: Key-set seek — materialize the semi-join key set, then seek the target with it
 *
 * Pattern (anchored on the physical hash semi join `join-physical-selection`
 * builds — rule id `key-set-seek` — and on the merge semi join
 * `monotonic-merge-join` / `join-physical-selection` build — rule id
 * `key-set-seek-merge`; one rule function serves both anchors):
 *
 *   BloomJoinNode | MergeJoinNode (semi, exactly one equi-pair, no residual)
 *     ├─ left:  (FilterNode | trivial ProjectNode | AliasNode)*
 *     │           over  SeqScan(fullScan) | ordering-only IndexScan(plan=0)
 *     │                 | IndexSeek carrying pushedConstraints
 *     └─ right: uncorrelated, deterministic, side-effect-free key source
 *
 * On a successful match the left chain is rebuilt with the leaf replaced by a
 * `KeySetSemiJoinNode(leaf, right)` — the semi join slides below the peeled
 * wrappers (a filter and a semi-filter commute; a trivial Project / Alias
 * preserves rows and attribute ids):
 *
 *   HashJoin(semi, Project(Filter(leaf)), right)
 *     →  Project(Filter(KeySetSemiJoin(leaf, right)))
 *
 * An `IndexSeek` leaf is admitted UNCHANGED, with the predicate its
 * `FilterInfo` enforces (recorded in `pushedConstraints`, dropped from the
 * tree on the module's promise) re-applied as a `Filter` directly above the
 * new node — inside the peeled wrappers, because a peeled trivial Project may
 * not carry the predicate's columns:
 *
 *   HashJoin(semi, Project(IndexSeek[s='x']), right)
 *     →  Project(Filter[s='x'](KeySetSemiJoin(IndexSeek[s='x'], right)))
 *
 * That is right on both runtime branches: the scan branch runs the leaf's own
 * FilterInfo untouched (the pushed seek happens exactly as today; the added
 * Filter is redundant), and the seek branch replaces the FilterInfo with the
 * multi-seek (the module ignores the pushed predicate; the Filter re-applies
 * it). The scan branch is byte-for-byte the plan being displaced, so the
 * rewrite is never a structural loss.
 *
 * The new node ALWAYS builds the key set and ALWAYS probes each target row
 * against it — the runtime pushdown only changes how many rows the target
 * emits, so a skipped or over-fetching seek can cost performance but never
 * correctness. Every gate below exists to make an UNDER-fetch (rows the seek
 * fails to return, which the probe cannot resurrect) impossible.
 *
 * The rule declines (returns null, keeping the join it arrived as) on all of:
 *   - join type ≠ semi, >1 equi-pair, or a residual condition
 *   - a correlated, non-deterministic, or side-effect-bearing key source
 *   - side effects anywhere in the left chain
 *   - any non-peelable node between the join and the access leaf
 *   - a walk leaf that is not an unconstrained every-row walk (residue in
 *     `FilterInfo.constraints`, or a pushed limit / offset)
 *   - a seek leaf failing any of {@link admitSeekLeaf}'s five gates:
 *     - a pushed limit / offset (a directive the multi-seek would not honour,
 *       and unlike a predicate it cannot be re-applied by a Filter without
 *       changing which rows are dropped — unreachable today,
 *       `monotonic-limit-pushdown`'s peel cannot cross a join, but kept)
 *     - no recorded `pushedConstraints` (a seek we cannot describe is a seek
 *       we must not displace)
 *     - a recorded predicate containing a relational node (this rule runs
 *       PostOptimization — a re-inserted relational subquery would reach emit
 *       unphysicalized)
 *     - a correlated subtree (`index-nested-loop` builds seeks keyed on the
 *       OUTER side of a join — re-applying is correct but the node drains the
 *       key source per outer row, turning a linear plan quadratic)
 *     - an emission order that absorbed a Sort (`orderingLoadBearing` —
 *       `seekPreservesTargetOrder` is false for every seek, so the absorbed
 *       order cannot be reproduced)
 *   - a walk leaf whose emission order absorbed a SortNode (`orderingLoadBearing`)
 *     UNLESS the seek would reproduce that order (`seekPreservesTargetOrder`:
 *     the seek index is the walk index, so a multi-seek emits a subsequence of
 *     the walk — still in the same order). Otherwise the dropped Sort's order,
 *     which rides the leaf's walk order through the order-preserving join,
 *     would be replaced by seek-key order
 *   - target/key logical types that do not share one seek key space
 *     (`sharesSeekKeySpace`: identical types, or any two of INTEGER / REAL /
 *     NUMERIC). Anything else could be encoded into seek keys that miss rows
 *     `=` considers equal
 *   - a semantic-ordering key type ('PT1H' ≡ 'PT60M' but byte-distinct: a
 *     raw-value seek under-fetches)
 *   - a collation cover that is MISMATCH_UNSAFE (a finer index under-fetches;
 *     a BINARY join over a coarser index is admitted — the probe trims the
 *     over-fetch)
 *   - the module declining either runtime-set probe, naming different indexes
 *     across them, claiming a composite seek, attaching a JS residualFilter,
 *     or naming an index the engine cannot resolve / whose leading key column
 *     is not the seek column
 *   - the module answering a synthesized probe with a plan `validateAccessPlan`
 *     rejects (a module bug — logged, then declined like any other gate rather
 *     than failing a query the user's own predicate would have run fine)
 *   - a break-even of zero (the module's own costs say the displaced plan —
 *     the plain scan for a walk leaf, the leaf's own pushed seek for a seek
 *     leaf — wins at every key count)
 *
 * The MERGE anchor adds two gates the hash anchor does not need:
 *   - `seekPreservesTargetOrder` must hold. `MergeJoinNode.computePhysical`
 *     propagates the probe side's `ordering` / `monotonicOn` for semi, so a
 *     Sort an earlier pass dropped on the strength of the merge join's order
 *     cannot come back — a replacement that cannot reproduce that order is a
 *     wrong-order plan, not a slow one. (`BloomJoinNode` propagates neither,
 *     so nothing above a hash join can have depended on an ordering claim —
 *     that asymmetry is the whole reason this gate is merge-only.)
 *   - the key source's PHYSICAL row estimate, when present, must not exceed
 *     min(maxKeys, breakEvenKeys) — the same expression the runtime's `push`
 *     decision uses. A merge semi join streams both sides; this node drains
 *     the key source into a Set before opening the target, so a rewrite whose
 *     seek then never fires is pure loss (the same scan, plus a set the merge
 *     join never built). The gate is a heuristic in BOTH directions: the
 *     estimate is advisory, and it counts ROWS while the runtime counts
 *     DISTINCT non-null keys, so a duplicate-heavy key source can be declined
 *     here and still have seeked. Both errors cost an optimization, never a
 *     row. The hash arm has no such gate because the hash join it replaces
 *     already built that set.
 *
 * NOTE: the three `getBestAccessPlan` probes run on every qualifying semi
 * join optimization, uncached. Cheap for both shipped modules; if a third-party
 * module with an expensive planner ever shows up in optimization profiles,
 * memoize by (table, seek column).
 *
 * NOTE: the `orderingLoadBearing` decline is conservative when
 * `seekPreservesTargetOrder` is false — a future enhancement could re-sort the
 * pushed output by the leaf's advertised order.
