/**
 * Rule: Nested-Loop Right-Side Cache Injection
 *
 * Required Characteristics:
 * - Node is a logical JoinNode that survived physical selection — i.e. a
 *   nested-loop join (equi-joins were already lowered to hash/merge, which
 *   materialize their build side on their own).
 * - Join type is left-driven (`inner` / `left` / `cross` / `semi` / `anti`):
 *   the runtime re-opens the right pipeline once per left row
 *   (`emitLoopJoin.driveFromLeft`). `right` / `full` drive from the right and
 *   scan each side once, so caching their right side only wastes memory.
 * - Right side is pure (no side effects — that is the mutating-subquery-cache
 *   rule's job), deterministic, uncorrelated, and small enough to materialize.
 *
 * Applied When:
 * - A pure right side would otherwise be re-scanned N times, one full scan per
 *   left row. Wrapping it in a run-once CacheNode replays the buffer instead.
 *
 * Benefits: Turns N full right-side scans into one scan + N buffer replays —
 * decisive on a high-per-read-latency vtab where each reopen costs I/O.

/**
 * A CTE reference (NOT_MATERIALIZED CTEs re-emit an inlined sub-plan; recursive
 * refs stream from a working table) manages its own row-context lifetime as it
 * iterates. Eagerly materializing such a right side via a CacheNode drains and
 * tears that context down before the join's ON-condition reads it, producing a
 * runtime "no row context" error (and, for shared inlined scans, corrupting the
 * outer loop's own context). Caching a CTE-backed right side is also low value:
 * a materialized CTE is already a buffer, and a NOT_MATERIALIZED one re-scans
 * cheap local state. So skip any right side whose subtree touches CTE machinery.
 *
 * NOTE: this is a CacheNode/CTEReference runtime-emit interaction, not a
 * planner-only limitation — the sibling mutating-subquery-cache rule shares it
 * but rarely fires on CTE right sides. See the ticket handoff for the follow-up.

/**
 * Best available row estimate for the buffer the CacheNode would hold: the
 * LARGEST estimate anywhere in the right subtree.
 *
 * We can't just read `right.physical.estimatedRows`. Two gaps make the top of
 * the subtree read too low:
 *  - Not every node propagates the physical estimate. The single-source relays and
 *    the join family do (`physicalSourceRows`), but a set operation, an async
 *    gather, or a CTE reference in between still stamps nothing, so the subtree top
 *    can be `undefined` while the leaf underneath has a count.
 *  - An access leaf's `physical.estimatedRows` is the *table* row count, but the
 *    module's own access-plan estimate (getBestAccessPlan `rows`, the true "how
 *    many rows will this scan hand back" — e.g. a high-latency vtab reporting
 *    60000) lives only in `filterInfo.indexInfoOutput.estimatedRows`.
 * Taking the subtree max over both signals is a conservative upper bound that
 * keeps the memory gate sound (never under-counts a large source into a cache).
 *
 * NOTE: this over-estimates a large base scan that a selective Filter shrinks —
 * output rows may be few, yet the max reflects the pre-filter scan. That biases
 * toward NOT caching such a right side (a missed optimization, never a memory
 * hazard). If a real workload wants those cached, read the subtree top instead of
 * the max — the Filter's own physical estimate now carries the post-filter count.
