/**
 * Rule: Join Predicate Pushdown
 *
 * For a `FilterNode(predicate, JoinNode)`, each conjunct of `predicate` whose
 * column references all land on ONE side of the join is MOVED onto that side's
 * branch (wrapped as a `FilterNode` around `join.left` / `join.right`).
 * Cross-side conjuncts, and anything the refusals below reject, stay in a
 * residual Filter above the rebuilt join.
 *
 * Why this is sound — the null-extension argument. A side may receive a
 * conjunct exactly when that side's columns are NEVER null-extended in the
 * join's output (read straight off `buildJoinAttributes` in
 * `nodes/join-utils.ts`). For such a side, every output row carries that side's
 * genuine input values, so rejecting an input row before the join removes
 * precisely the output rows the conjunct would have removed after it. On a
 * null-extended side the two differ: `left join r … where r.date > 'x'` drops
 * the NULL-padded rows after the join, but pushing `r.date > 'x'` below would
 * KEEP them (the left row simply finds no match and is padded again).
 *
 * | joinType | null-extended side | conjuncts pushable to |
 * |----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
 * | `inner`  | neither            | left and right        |
 * | `cross`  | neither            | left and right        |
 * | `left`   | right              | left only             |
 * | `right`  | left               | right only            |
 * | `full`   | both               | neither — rule declines |
 * | `semi`   | n/a (output is left columns) | left only   |
 * | `anti`   | n/a (output is left columns) | left only   |
 *
 * For `semi`/`anti` the left-only restriction is moot in practice —
 * `buildJoinAttributes` returns only the left attributes, so a Filter above such
 * a join cannot reference a right column at all — but it is encoded anyway so
 * the table is exhaustive and the reasoning stays local.
 *
 * Attribution is a plain attribute-id set test: ids are minted per node instance
 * and are stable across this pass's rewrites, so a self-join's two branches
 * carry distinct ids, and a join's `exists … as` flag ids are in neither side's
 * set (a conjunct over a flag falls out as un-pushable with no special case).
 *
 * Refusals:
 * - A conjunct whose subtree references a RELATIONAL child (any subquery) is
 *   left above. The id collector descends through relational children too, so
 *   `exists (select 1 from x where x.a = e.id and x.b = t.id)` contributes `x`'s
 *   own ids — which belong to neither side — and the conjunct is declined. That
 *   descent is load-bearing: a scalar-only walk would see only `e.id` and push a
 *   conjunct onto the left branch where `t.id` does not resolve.
 * - Symmetrically, a conjunct naming a column from OUTSIDE the join — an outer
 *   reference, when this `Filter(Join)` is itself the body of a correlated
 *   subquery — sees an id in neither side's set and is declined.
 *   NOTE: sound but pessimistic — `x.a = <outer>.b` would be safe on the `x`
 *   branch. Ignoring "in neither side" ids instead of refusing on them would
 *   recover that. {@link collectSubtreeAttributeIds} does not distinguish a
 *   genuinely-outer id from a subquery-internal one, but
 *   `analysis/predicate-dependencies.ts` does — its `correlated` set is exactly
 *   the outer ids, and swapping this walk for it is the whole change. Left alone
 *   until a real correlated body is measured losing a seek to it; the swap also
 *   makes more conjuncts pushable, which needs its own plan-shape coverage.
 * - A conjunct with NO column references (`where 1 = 1`, `where :p > 0`) stays
 *   above; pushing it buys nothing and would make the rule fire on plans it
 *   should leave alone.
 * - A non-functional conjunct (`random() < e.amount`) stays above — moving it
 *   below the join changes how many times it is evaluated.
 * - A branch whose subtree carries a write keeps ITS conjuncts above while the
 *   other branch still receives its own (per-branch refusal, unlike
 *   `rule-predicate-inference-equivalence`'s outright one).
 *
 * A pushed conjunct is MOVED, not copied. A redundant copy above would
 * re-evaluate per output row for no gain and, worse, make the rule
 * non-idempotent — it would find the same pushable conjunct on every visit.
 * With a move, a re-visit of the residual Filter finds nothing pushable and
 * returns null, which is the termination argument.
