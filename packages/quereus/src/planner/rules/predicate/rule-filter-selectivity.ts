/**
 * Rule: Filter Selectivity
 *
 * Stamps a stats-derived selectivity onto a FilterNode so its `estimatedRows`
 * reflects real column statistics instead of the flat DEFAULT_FILTER_SELECTIVITY.
 *
 * Registered THREE times, all bottom-up. Only the first derives an estimate the plan
 * did not have; the other two recover one that a later pass dropped, because
 * `FilterNode.withChildren` carries `selectivity` forward only when the predicate
 * child is the same object, and several passes rewrite inside a predicate:
 *
 *   - `filter-selectivity` (Physical pass), the primary stamp. Fires AFTER the
 *     Structural pass — predicate-pushdown / grow-retrieve have already put the Filter
 *     in its final position over its final source, so the source subtree is settled
 *     (and may carry physical access nodes between the join and its table references).
 *     This stamp is what the physical and PostOptimization cost readers consult.
 *   - `filter-selectivity-restamp` (PostOptimization pass, registered FIRST in that
 *     pass so it precedes `filter-conjunct-ordering`, which copies the stamp forward).
 *     Recovers the estimate for a Filter whose predicate PostOptimization itself
 *     rewrote — `scalar-subquery-cache` wrapping an uncorrelated scalar subquery's
 *     inner re-mints every scalar ancestor up to the predicate. It has to run inside
 *     that pass, not merely after it, because the cost readers later in the pass
 *     (join-physical-selection, key-set-seek, the materialization advisory) consult
 *     the stamp.
 *   - `filter-selectivity-final` (FinalEstimates pass, order 37), the backstop behind
 *     every plan-mutating pass. Recovers the estimate for a Filter re-minted by the
 *     Materialization advisory (order 35) — which rebuilds every path on which it
 *     marks a `with` clause for shared materialization or injects a `CacheNode` — and
 *     for any future pass ordered before it. Its stamp is read only at emission, so
 *     it cannot substitute for the PostOptimization registration.
 *
 * The `selectivity !== undefined` guard below makes the second and third registrations
 * a no-op on every Filter whose stamp survived, so they only ever fill in, never
 * overwrite. All three firings read a physical source subtree (`select-access-path` has
 * already replaced Retrieve with an access node by the Physical pass's own bottom-up
 * order); later sources are the same shape or further lowered — a `CacheNode` the
 * advisory newly slid under the Filter is a generic single-relation wrapper that both
 * `extractRowSourceTableSchema` and `collectColumnOrigins` descend, so the re-derived
 * number matches what the Physical pass produced.
 *
 * Node-level accessors (`estimatedRows` / `computePhysical`) carry no OptContext,
 * so a Filter cannot consult `context.stats` from inside itself. This rule holds
 * the context, does the lookup, and mints a stamped Filter — the estimate then
 * flows through `estimatedRows` automatically.
 *
 * Two paths:
 *   - **single-table** — `extractRowSourceTableSchema` finds one base table under
 *     the Filter *whose rows are the ones arriving at it*; hand the whole predicate
 *     to the provider, which decomposes its boolean structure itself.
 *   - **multi-relation** — the source spans several tables (a join), or the strict
 *     walk declined. Split the predicate into conjuncts, attribute each to the base
 *     table(s) its columns come from, estimate per conjunct, and combine.
 *
 * The strict walk matters because an aggregate's output rows are a different
 * population from its source's, so no fraction of the base table describes them at
 * all: over `select cat, count(*) as ct from o group by cat having ct > 2` the
 * permissive `extractTableSchema` reaches `o` through the aggregate, but `o`'s row
 * count and column distributions say nothing about how many GROUPS survive `ct > 2`.
 *
 * Both paths hand the provider a {@link ColumnStatsResolver} built from
 * `collectColumnOrigins`, so a column in the predicate is matched to statistics by
 * ATTRIBUTE IDENTITY rather than by the name in its AST. `ProjectNode` forwards the
 * source attribute id for a bare column reference and mints a fresh one for a
 * computed expression, which is exactly the distinction wanted: `select cat as qty`
 * still reads `o.cat`'s statistics, while `select id * 7 as qty` reads none rather
 * than borrowing `o.qty`'s because the alias happens to collide. A CTE reference
 * republishes its body's columns under per-reference relation instances, so a `with`
 * clause estimates like the equivalent subquery while the two arms of a CTE self-join
 * still count as two relations — see `column-origins.ts`.

/**
 * Estimate a filter whose source spans several base tables by attributing each
 * conjunct to the relation(s) its columns come from.
 *
 * NOTE: join type is ignored. A `left`/`right`/`full` join emits NULL-extended
 * rows, which makes a predicate on the non-preserved side more selective than the
 * base-table fraction suggests and one on the preserved side less so. Applying the
 * base-table fraction either way is the conventional simplification, not an
 * oversight.
 *
 * NOTE: an `aggregate` between the Filter and the join forwards group-key attribute
 * ids unchanged, so a predicate on a group key is attributed to its base table and
 * the base-table fraction is applied to post-aggregate cardinality. Imprecise but
 * not unsound; deliberately not special-cased.
 *
 * NOTE: the stamped number does move `estimatedRows` above a join — the join family
 * derives its physical cardinality from its children's PHYSICAL counts
 * (`physicalSourceRows` / `joinPhysicalRows`), so a Filter over a join has a real
 * number to multiply. It still has nothing to multiply above a `union`/`union all`,
 * where `SetOperationNode` stamps no count at all (backlog
 * `debt-row-estimates-die-at-set-operations`).
