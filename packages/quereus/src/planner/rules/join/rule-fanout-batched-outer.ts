/**
 * Rule: Fan-out Batched Outer
 *
 * Flips an already-formed `FanOutLookupJoinNode` from the default `serial` outer
 * mode to `batched` (cross-row pipelined) when the cost model says overlapping
 * lookups *across* outer rows pays off. This is the recognition rule that
 * *chooses* the batched runtime (`runFanOutLookupJoinBatched`); the runtime
 * itself landed in `parallel-fanout-lookup-join-batched-outer`.
 *
 * **Why a post-pass, not a formation-time decision.** `rule-fanout-lookup-join`
 * forms the node in `PassId.Structural`; this rule runs in `PassId.Post-
 * Optimization` (in the `eager-prefetch-probe` / `async-gather`
 * neighborhood) after physical-pass selection has finalized leaf
 * `expectedLatencyMs` / `estimatedRows` / `concurrencySafe`. Matching the
 * already-built `FanOutLookupJoinNode` keeps the batched decision a single,
 * isolated rewrite rather than another recognition path.
 *
 * **When batched wins.** Batched mode helps when there are *many outer rows but
 * few branches per row* — the per-row branch count under-saturates the global
 * in-flight budget, so admitting more outer rows ahead of the emit frontier is
 * the only way to fill it. All of the following must hold:
 *
 *   - **Budget under-saturated per row:** `branchCount < outerBatchConcurrency`.
 *     When a single row's branches already meet/exceed the global budget,
 *     cross-row admission buys nothing (the budget is full from one row).
 *   - **High-latency branches:** the slowest branch's `expectedLatencyMs` clears
 *     `tuning.parallel.batchedOuterThresholdMs`. This is 0 on every memory-vtab
 *     leaf, so the rule is **inert by design on local-only plans** — the golden
 *     sweep is unaffected, same discipline as `gatherThresholdMs` /
 *     `prefetchProbeThresholdMs`.
 *   - **Large outer cardinality:** `outer.estimatedRows >= batchedOuterMinRows`,
 *     so cross-row overlap dominates the reorder-buffer + per-row-fork overhead.
 *     An unknown estimate fails the gate (never flip on a missing statistic).
 *
 * **Cross branches are out of scope.** A cross (1:n) branch's batched outer
 * mode is owned by `parallel-fanout-lookup-join-cross-mode`; this rule only
 * flips clusters whose branches are all `atMostOne-*`. A node carrying any
 * `cross` or `cross-left` branch is left serial (both are 1:n cross factors).
 *
 * **Outer-source isolation (load-bearing correctness).** The batched driver
 * pumps the outer source *concurrently* with in-flight per-row branch forks —
 * unlike serial mode, which fully resolves one outer row before pulling the
 * next. The scheduler runs every instruction against one shared
 * `RuntimeContext`, so a raw outer sub-plan that mutates `rctx.context` during
 * the pump (installing a row slot, etc.) would (a) risk a torn read for any
 * branch reading that entry and (b) throw a strict-fork violation when the
 * fan-out is nested under another fork (so `rctx.context` is strict-wrapped) and
 * the live row forks hold the bump counter. To neutralize both, this rule wraps
 * the outer in an `EagerPrefetchNode` when it flips to batched: the prefetch
 * pump runs the outer sub-plan against its *own* forked context (mutations land
 * on the fork, never on the shared `rctx.context` the row forks bump), and the
 * batched pump merely drains the prefetch buffer — a pure buffer read that never
 * touches `rctx.context`. So **batched implies prefetch** (the reverse does not
 * hold; `eager-prefetch-probe` uses the node independently). The prefetch buffer
 * also feeds the read-ahead window the batched driver consumes across rows, so
 * the two compose rather than duplicate work. The branch correlations are
 * already safe by construction: `rule-fanout-lookup-join` only clusters branches
 * (spine + correlated scalar-aggregate subqueries) that reference the *outer
 * row's* attributes, which the batched driver isolates per row in its own boxed
 * slot.
 *
 * **Outer concurrency gate.** Because the prefetch pump iterates the outer
 * concurrently with branch lookups, the outer must advertise
 * `physical.concurrencySafe === true` (mirroring `eager-prefetch-probe` /
 * `async-gather`). Serial mode never overlapped these, so this gate is
 * batched-specific.
 *
 * **Idempotence.** After the rewrite `outerMode === 'batched'`, so a second
 * firing returns null immediately.
