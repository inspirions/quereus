	//    environment clears the caller's CTE namespace and a fragment sub-select reading a
	//    body-local block would have nothing to bind to (it errors `Table 'c' not found`,

 *
 * The match is by **relation identity**, not bare column name. Every lens class now
 * supplies `referencedWriteRowRelations` — each referenced write-row basis column tagged
 * with the member relation that owns it (`lens-enforcement.ts` sources it from the slot's
 * decomposition advertisement / single basis source). This is load-bearing on a

 * columns (e.g. two members both spelling their value column `val`): a bare-name gate
 * would mis-thread a constraint over member A's `val` onto sibling member B's op (which
 * also has a `val`), and the deferred check then crashes on B's row context. Relation
 * matching routes it onto member A's op alone (or onto none — deferred — when its columns
 * span more than one member).
 *
 * Only when a constraint's owning relation could not be resolved (`referencedWriteRowRelations`
 * undefined — an EAV-pivot / opaque slot) does the gate fall back to the bare-name path:
 * the prover-supplied `referencedWriteRowColumns` (row-local) else the {@link writeRowColumns}
 * AST walk (FK / set-level). The walk under-collects a correlated bare write-row ref nested
 * in a subquery, which is why the row-local metadata is preferred even in the fallback.
 *
 * `extraConstraints` is exclusively lens-synthesized (the basis table's own checks are
 * added inside `buildConstraintChecks` from `tableSchema.checkConstraints`, never via
 * this seam), so gating every entry is safe.
 *
 * `op` is typed structurally on just its `table` so BOTH fan-out op shapes satisfy it: a
 * `BaseOp` (the single-source spine and the multi-source / decomposition UPDATE + DELETE
 * fan-out) and a `DecompInsertOp` (the decomposition INSERT fan-out, which routes per
