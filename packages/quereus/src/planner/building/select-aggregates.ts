 *
 * Two match rules, in order at each node:

 * 1. The whole subtree's identity fingerprint equals a GROUP BY expression's — covers
 *    `group by a || '!'` + `over (order by a || '!')`, and nested occurrences such
 *    as `over (order by upper(a || '!'))` because the walk recurses. Identifier case
 *    is folded, so `group by A || '!'` matches too; quoted literals are byte-exact,
 *    so `a || 'X'` and `a || 'x'` remain different keys.
 *
 *    Unconditional above any subquery, where the expression is written in this query's
 *    own scope. INSIDE a subquery it is guarded by {@link readsOnlyAggregateInput} —
 *    every column reference in the subtree must be a pre-grouping column of THIS query
 *    — because there the same text can name something else entirely: under `group by
 *    a`, a bare `a` written inside `over (order by (select … where t.a = a))` names the
 *    subquery's own `t.a` and yet fingerprints as `a`, so an unguarded rule 1 would
 *    silently rewrite it into the outer group column and change what the query means.
 *    The guard cannot replace the top-level case: `group by (select max(t.b) from wg t
 *    where t.a = wg.a)` repeated verbatim in the specification is a legal grouping key
 *    whose subtree also reads the subquery's own columns.
 * 2. The node is a column reference whose attribute id is the *base* attribute id of
 *    a bare-column grouping key — covers `group by a` + `over (order by wg.a)` and
 *    `over (order by w.a)`. Both spellings fall through to the same base attribute
 *    the group key was built from, so the match is qualifier-independent. It needs no
 *    guard at any depth: attribute ids are minted per relation instance, so only a
 *    reference that genuinely resolves to this query's grouping column can match.
 *
 * Otherwise recurse into every child, relational ones included, rebuilding through
 * `withChildren` — a correlated reference to a grouping key can live arbitrarily deep
 * inside a subquery in the window specification, and it must be redirected there too
 * or it reaches the runtime as a base-table attribute the grouped row never carried.
 *
 * NOTE: rule 1 matches by AST text, so a subtree that *reads* like a grouping key but
 * resolves to something else could be redirected wrongly. Within one query the guard
 * above closes that off; the residue is a subtree of ENCLOSING-query references that
 * happens to spell a grouping key (`group by a` in an inner query whose window spec
 * says `outer_alias.a`… only when that fingerprints identically). This is the same
 * limitation the select list already carries through the shared {@link GroupKeyIndex};
 * fixing it means comparing resolved attribute identity rather than text, for both
