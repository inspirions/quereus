 *
 * The equivalence: the scan branch leaves the leaf's `FilterInfo` untouched, so
 * rows arrive in the walk index's key order; the seek branch replaces it with a
 * `plan=5` multi-seek whose engine-wide contract is that rows come back in the
 * *scanned structure's own key order*, never seek-argument order (pinned by
 * `test/vtab/multiseek-key-order.spec.ts`, honoured by both backends). When the
 * seek index IS the walk index, the seek branch therefore emits a subsequence
 * of the scan branch's stream — and a subsequence of an ordered stream is still
 * ordered (a subsequence of a monotonic stream is still monotonic, strictness
 * included: dropping rows cannot create a tie). So under that condition both
 * branches satisfy the leaf's advertised order and the node may claim it.
 *
 * Restricted to a single-column index: for a composite index the seek would be
 * a leading-column *prefix* window, and "structure key order within a prefix
 * window" is not pinned by any current test. It costs nothing today — the
 * memory module declines a runtime-set `IN` on the leading column of a
 * composite key, and the literal form plans as a scan + Filter, so the
 * composite case is unreachable through either path. Relax the clause when a
 * module actually claims a leading-column multi-seek on a composite index, and
 * pin the prefix-window order first.
