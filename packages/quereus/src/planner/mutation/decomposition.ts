/**
 * Advertisement-driven **put** fan-out for a logical table backed by an n-way
 * decomposition (columnar split / column-family / EAV), the write dual of the
 * `get` join `schema/lens-compiler.ts` synthesizes (`compileDecompositionBody`).
 * See `docs/lens.md` § The Default Mapper and `docs/view-updateability.md`
 * § Decomposition put fan-out.
 *
 * A decomposition lens is registered as an ordinary view whose `selectAst` is the
 * synthesized `anchor ⋈ members` join, so writing it would otherwise route to the
 * generic two-table-inner-join `multi-source.ts` path — which has the **wrong**
 * semantics for a decomposition (it picks a single delete side, rejects > 2
 * members, and rejects the outer joins optional members ride). `propagate()`
 * intercepts a decomposition body (the slot carries a `primary-storage`
 * advertisement and no override) and routes it here instead.
 *
 * **Scope shipped here (DELETE / UPDATE in this module; INSERT off the envelope
 * built in `building/view-mutation-builder.ts`):**
 *
 * - **DELETE** fans out to *every* member (mandatory, optional, and EAV pivot) so
 *   the logical row ceases to exist across the whole decomposition. Members are
 *   ordered **anchor-last**; each non-anchor member's identifying set is read from
 *   the **anchor alone** (never the full join), so an earlier member's delete can
 *   never shrink a later member's identifying set. This is what keeps the fan-out
 *   sound without the snapshot-consistent multi-member execution substrate.
 * - **UPDATE** routes each assignment to the member that backs it, keyed off the
 *   anchor the same anchor-last way. A **mandatory, non-EAV** member takes one base
 *   UPDATE. An **optional columnar** member's write is a per-row materialization
 *   transition realized as plain AST base ops over the anchor, routed by the assigned
 *   **value shape** ({@link lowerMaterializedValue}): a **constant** value takes the
 *   matched base UPDATE + an absent null-extended INSERT (anchor-keyed insert-select
 *   `… on conflict (<memberKey>) do nothing`, which cedes the matched rows to the
 *   UPDATE without the insert source scanning its own target), or — when every value
 *   column is assigned null — a base DELETE instead; an **anchor-resolvable** value
 *   (`set c = a + 1`, every leaf lowers to an anchor base column) collapses both
 *   branches into a single `… on conflict (<memberKey>) do update set c = excluded.c`
 *   upsert (the value computed once over the anchor scan, matched rows reading it via
 *   `excluded.<col>`); a **member self-reference** (`set c = c + 1`, `set c = coalesce(c, 0)
 *   + 1`) keeps the matched UPDATE for present rows **and** adds a materialize INSERT for absent
 *   rows that projects the self-expression with the owner's own columns substituted to NULL,
 *   gated by a runtime non-empty filter (so a null-propagating expression materializes nothing
 *   while a null→non-null one does) and `on conflict (<memberKey>) do nothing` to cede matched
 *   rows — the two ops stay distinct because the matched and materialize values are computed over
 *   different scans. An **arbitrary** columnar value — one that embeds a subquery, reads a
 *   *different* member's column, or mixes anchor + self leaves (`set c = b + 1`, `set c = c + a`,
 *   `set c = (select …)`) — now rides a **single-identity (anchor-key) per-row capture** instead
 *   of rejecting: every affected row's value is materialized ONCE over the planned get body (which
 *   null-extends an absent optional member, so the captured value already encodes per-row presence)
 *   into the multi-source `__vmupd_keys` substrate, and the matched UPDATE reads it back keyed by
 *   the member key while a filtered materialize INSERT reads it keyed by the anchor key, gated on a
 *   **runtime** non-null (the value is data-dependent, so the plan-time `foldsConstantFalse` of the
 *   `self` fast-lane cannot decide it). Capturing the value pre-mutation is what makes a both-sides
 *   write (`set c = b + 1, b = b + 100`) read `c` from the *pre-mutation* `b`
 *   ({@link emitCapturedMemberUpdate} / {@link buildCapturedMaterializeInsert}; the capture relation
 *   is {@link buildDecompositionKeyCapture}). A mixed anchor+self group rides this path too — it
 *   subsumes the retired same-statement reject. An
 *   **EAV pivot** member's write is the triple analogue, per attribute: a null deletes
 *   the triple, an anchor-resolvable value upserts it via `do update`, a constant value
 *   upserts it via matched UPDATE + `do nothing` materialize INSERT, and an **arbitrary EAV**
 *   value (a subquery, a cross-member column, an anchor+self mix, or any EAV self-reference —
 *   which an EAV value column lowers to a subquery for) rides the **same single-identity capture**
 *   as the columnar arbitrary case: the captured value substitutes the get-body projection over the
 *   anchor scan, the matched UPDATE reads it back by the entity column, and a non-null-filtered
 *   materialize INSERT reads it back by the anchor key (`on conflict (entity, attr) do nothing`).
 * - **INSERT** fans out to one insert per member, **anchor first** (FK-order root).
 *   It rides the shared-surrogate mutation envelope `view-mutation-shared-surrogate-insert`
 *   ships (`ViewMutationNode.envelope` + `EnvelopeScanNode`): the user source is
 *   materialized once, the surrogate value is sourced from the **anchor key column's
 *   declared `default`** — evaluated once per row at the envelope (with
 *   `mutation_ordinal()` in scope), so the basis author chooses the ID policy and the
 *   engine invents nothing — and threaded into every member's key column(s) via the
 *   equivalence class, with each member reading the identical rows back.
 *   `logical-tuple` keys thread the supplied logical PK; no default. Optional members are inserted only for rows that
 *   supply ≥1 of their columns (a per-row presence filter — the outer-join
 *   semantics the read preserves); EAV pivot members emit one triple insert per
 *   supplied attribute, gated on a non-null value. The plan-agnostic decomposition
 *   is {@link analyzeDecompositionInsert} here; the plan-node build (envelope +
 *   per-member projections) is `buildDecompositionInsert` in the builder, mirroring
 *   the multi-source insert split.
 *
 * **Deferred (raised here with a precise diagnostic), because each rides a
 * substrate that is not yet present:**
 *
 * - A DELETE/UPDATE **WHERE that references a non-anchor member** (an EAV pivot, or an
 *   embedded subquery) — needs the snapshot-consistent multi-member base-op execution
 *   the predicate-honest multi-side fan-out is deferred onto (see `multi-source.ts`
 *   § delete + the `view-mutation-lenient-multiside-delete-fanout` backlog ticket). A
 *   WHERE that is **anchor-resolvable** — an anchor identity column **or** a computed
 *   mapping whose basis lives on the anchor (`bumped = a + 1`, `combined = a || b`) —
 *   is *supported*: it substitutes into a predicate over the anchor's own base columns,
 *   which the anchor subquery already evaluates, so it does not defer.
 * - **UPDATE of a shared-key column** — a key write is an identity change, not a
 *   value write. (Optional-member and EAV value writes — including arbitrary captured
 *   values — are **supported**, see the UPDATE bullet above; only a key/identity write
 *   stays rejected.)
 * - **composite shared keys** — v1 threads a single-column key (mirrors the
 *   single-column-PK boundary in `multi-source.ts`).

 *
 * - **constant** (no column ref, or a null literal) — survives both scopes trivially.
 * - **anchor** — every leaf resolves to an anchor base column (`set c = a + 1`). The value
 *   is computed once over the anchor scan and the two branches are unified by an upsert
 *   ({@link buildOptionalMemberInsertSelect} `do update`), so the matched side reads the
 *   identical anchor-computed value via `excluded.<col>`.
 * - **self** (columnar only) — every leaf is the owning member's own column (`set c = c + 1`,
 *   `set c = coalesce(c, 0) + 1`). Present rows take the matched UPDATE (their real prior value);
 *   absent rows take a materialize INSERT computing the self-expression with the owner's columns
 *   substituted to NULL, gated by a runtime non-empty filter. The matched and materialize branches
 *   read different scans (member vs null-substituted anchor), so they stay two distinct ops — not
 *   an upsert (see {@link emitOptionalMemberUpdate} / {@link buildSelfMaterializeInsertSelect}).
 *
 * Anything else — a subquery, a cross-member column, an unqualified ref, or a single value
 * mixing anchor and self leaves — is **arbitrary**. With a capture carrier present (`canCapture`)
 * it is admitted as `captured` on **both** an optional columnar member and an **EAV** member:
 * lowered to base terms and (at emit) projected into the up-front `__vmupd_keys` set, read back by
 * the stitch key in both branches — by the member key for columnar ({@link emitCapturedMemberUpdate}),
 * by the entity column / anchor key for the EAV per-attribute triple pair ({@link emitEavMemberUpdate}).
 * An EAV value column substitutes to a correlated subquery, so an EAV self-reference (`set p = p + 1`)
 * lowers to a subquery and reaches here as `captured` (only the carrier-absent legacy
 * `propagateDecomposition` path still rejects it). Classification reads the lowered value's
 * column-ref **relationId qualifiers** (the synthesized body aliases each member by its
 * relationId — the same qualifier {@link rewriteAssignedValue} keys cross-member rejection on);
 * the owner is never the anchor (an optional/EAV member is mandatory-distinct), so `anchor` and

 *
 * The select is additionally **filtered to a non-empty materialized image**:

 * row, while one that maps null → non-null (`coalesce(c, 0) + 1` → `1`) is constant-true and
 * materializes. `on conflict (<memberKey>) do nothing` cedes present rows to the matched UPDATE
 * (which runs first), so only genuinely-absent rows are created — never an upsert (the matched and
 * materialize values are computed over different scans and disagree row-for-row by construction).
 *
 * The caller emits this builder (and therefore runs the two soundness gates) **only when the
 * materialize is statically live** — when the null-substituted non-empty filter cannot be proven
 * constant-false at plan time ({@link foldsConstantFalse}). A provably-dead materialize is skipped
