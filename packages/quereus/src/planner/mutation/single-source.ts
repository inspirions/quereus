/**
 * Single-source view-mediated DML rewriting (the single-source spine of the
 * view-mutation substrate).
 *
 * When an INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE targets a view whose body is a single-source
 * projection-and-filter, these helpers analyse the body and produce an
 * equivalent statement targeting the underlying base table. The base statement
 * is then planned by the ordinary base-table builder, so all constraint /
 * conflict / RETURNING / FK / mutation-context machinery is reused verbatim and
 * `getChangeScope()` / `Database.watch` see the base write with no extra wiring.
 *
 * These produce exactly one {@link import('./propagate.js').BaseOp} per call;
 * `propagate()` wraps the result and the builder (`building/view-mutation-builder.ts`)
 * re-plans it into a `ViewMutationNode`. Multi-source fan-out (more than one
 * base op) is the next phase.
 *
 * The same rewrite drives **materialized-view write-through**: every MV is
 * (post row-time consolidation) a single-source projection-and-filter — a strict
 * subset of the shape this classifier accepts — so DML targeting an MV name is
 * rewritten to its source `T` and re-planned identically; the existing row-time
 * maintenance hook then brings the backing into sync within the same statement
 * (reads-own-writes, rollback in lockstep). Hence the view parameter is the
 * minimal {@link MutableViewLike} structural shape both `ViewSchema` and a
 * maintained table's `maintainedTableViewLike` adapter satisfy — the rewrite
 * reads only `name` / `schemaName` / `selectAst` / `columns`. See
 * `docs/materialized-views.md` § Write boundary and `docs/view-updateability.md`.
 *
 * RETURNING-through-views is supported: {@link rewriteViewReturning} rewrites the
 * clause into base terms and attaches it to the rewritten base statement, so the
 * base op's own RETURNING machinery yields the view-projected post-mutation rows
 * (insert/update against NEW, delete against OLD; computed view columns
 * re-evaluated against the post-mutation base values).
