/**
 * Multi-source view-mediated DML decomposition — the **key-preserving join**
 * acceptance case of the view-mutation substrate (docs/vu-operators.md
 * § Inner Join, § Outer Joins; docs/view-updateability.md § Multi-Base-Table Mutations).
 *
 * Scope: a view body that is an **n-way (≥2) equi-join** of base tables — `inner`,
 * `left`, or `full` — including composite-PK sides and **self-joins** (one base table
 * under two or more distinct aliases) — written through with `update` / `delete` /
 * `insert`. **LEFT** and **RIGHT** outer joins are admitted for the
 * **statically-expressible** cases: preserved-side update passthrough,
 * delete-to-the-preserved-side, and insert routing (both-side / preserved-only /
 * presence-gated non-preserved member). RIGHT is the exact **mirror** of LEFT — the
 * right operand of a `right` join is preserved, the left operand is null-extended — and
 * the runtime now executes a RIGHT join (`outer-join-right-full-runtime`), so a
 * RIGHT-join view is both readable and writable. **FULL** is admitted only to carry its
 * precise conservative diagnostics (no preserved side, so all writes reject and the
 * surfaces report all-`NO`; FULL write-through — a preserved anchor for a body that is
 * null-extended per row — is a separable future concern). The one outer-join case that
 * needs new runtime — an UPDATE of a **non-preserved** column (a per-row matched-update /
 * null-extended-insert branch) — defers with `unsupported-outer-join-update`
 * (`view-write-optional-member-transitions`). The body is
 * **planned once**
 * (`analyzeJoinView`); its `PhysicalProperties.updateLineage` (threaded by
 * `view-mutation-physical-lineage`) routes each output column to its owning base
 * table. Each per-base SET/value is still lowered to an AST `BaseOp` so the ordinary
 * base-table builders are reused verbatim (the documented lower-risk path — the base
 * builders stay untouched), but **row identification no longer round-trips through a
 * re-planned AST body**: every affected view row's base-PK identities are captured
 * ONCE up-front, built as plan nodes directly over the already-planned join body
 * (`Project_{k<side>}(Filter_{idPred}(joinNode))` — the derived backward walk the
 * docs name, § Round-Trip Laws and the Derived Backward Walk), materialized before
 * any base op fires, and each base op reads its identifying values back from that
 * `__vmupd_keys` set:
 *
 * ```sql
 * -- view: select j1.id as id, j1.a as a, j2.c as c
 * --       from tj1 j1 join tj2 j2 on j2.id = j1.t2id
 * update jv set a = 5, c = 9 where id = 3
 *   -- capture (plan nodes over the planned join body, materialized once):
 *   --   __vmupd_keys = π_{j1.id as k0, j2.id as k1}( σ_{id = 3}( tj1 ⋈ tj2 ) )
 *   ->  update tj1 set a = 5 where id in (select k0 from __vmupd_keys)
 *       update tj2 set c = 9 where id in (select k1 from __vmupd_keys)
 * ```
 *
 * The capture reconstructs the row-identifying predicate (each owning side's base PK)
 * from the planned join body — exactly the predicate the optimizer already proves a
 * key over — so a side whose own PK is hidden by the projection (`tj2.id` above) is
 * still addressable, and a both-sides write is mutation-order-independent (the
 * FK-parent op cannot rewrite a predicate column out from under the FK-child op).
 * UPDATE RETURNING re-queries the same planned `joinNode` (post-mutation, restricted
 * to the captured identities); DELETE RETURNING projects the planned body `root` (the
 * `pre` OLD image). The body is planned once and reused — no second `buildSelectStmt`
 * / `cloneFromClause` of it for identification or RETURNING.
 *
 * Multi-source **`insert`** is analysed here (`analyzeMultiSourceInsert`) but *built* by
 * `building/view-mutation-builder.ts` (`buildMultiSourceInsert`), because it needs the
 * plan-level shared-surrogate envelope rather than an AST `BaseOp`: the shared join key is
 * not a view column, so it is sourced from the anchor key column's declared `default` once
 * per row at the envelope and threaded into the active base inserts via the equivalence
 * class (§ Mutation Context). For an outer join the **non-preserved** side is an *optional*
 * member of the fan-out — dropped when its columns are absent (the preserved-only insert),
 * presence-gated per row when supplied (the both-side insert).
 *
 * **Deferred, rejected here with a structured diagnostic:**
 * - UPDATE of a non-preserved outer-join column — `unsupported-outer-join-update`.
 * - INSERT of only non-preserved columns with no preserved anchor — `null-extended-create-conflict`.
 * - cross / set-op / aggregate / window bodies — `unsupported-*`.
 * - comma (implicit) joins, `select *` join bodies, and cross-side `set` value
 *   references — each a precise diagnostic.
 * - composite **shared-key insert** (the surrogate envelope threads a single-column
 *   key) — `unsupported-decomposition-key`. (Composite-PK *identification* on the
 *   update/delete capture path IS supported here; only the insert envelope's shared
 *   key stays single-column.)

 * (the alias-only analog of the view-column descent's column-name shadowing); a nested
 * *owning*-side reference whose qualifier is NOT shadowed is still correlated to the
 * target row of the lowered UPDATE just like a top-level one.
 *

 * (`from things c` shadowing owning alias `c`; `from aux parent` shadowing a side's table
 * name `parent`) is left subquery-local — never stripped to bare, never mis-routed
 * through the capture. Injected base-term lineage leaves carry side aliases a user
 * subquery would not intentionally reuse, so they are never shadowed; the narrowing
 * affects only genuine user collisions.
 *
 * The owning-side qualifier set is checked **before** the other-side set, so a self-join
 * (where an `other` side shares the owning side's table name) still strips an owning-alias
 * reference; only a reference qualified by a *different alias* is the cross-source case.
 *
 * A **bare** leaf is left untouched — binding locally (a nested subquery's own FROM, or
 * the lowered single-table UPDATE's target) or failing loudly at build. The strip never
 * resolves a bare name against the view sides: every base-term lineage leaf was
 * side-alias-qualified when `substituteViewColumns` injected it
 * ({@link makeSideQualifyScope} — including a partner column the body projected bare, so
 * that read rides the qualified routing below at ANY non-shadowed nesting depth), and
 * resolving a bare name here would mis-route an inner-scope column whose name merely collides with a
 * partner base column (e.g. `(select psecret from t)` where the partner side also has a
 * `psecret`) to the partner's captured value.
 *
 * A cross-source read is rewritten to `(select <srcN> from __vmupd_keys k where
 * k.k<owningSide>_0 = __vm_self.<pk0> [and …])`: `registerCrossSource` projects the partner
 * column into the capture under `srcN` and returns the alias; the `<pk_j>` (qualified with
 * the lowered UPDATE's `__vm_self` correlation alias — {@link SELF_ALIAS}) bind to its own
 * target row, so each row reads the captured pre-mutation
 * partner value of its joined row. The cross-source gate (`gateCrossSourceReads`) has
 * already proved every reached partner column has `base` lineage.
 *
 * Before the rewrite, `gateCrossSourceCardinality` (when supplied) rejects the **1:many**

 * so the correlated read-back is well-defined only when the owning side joins **at most one**

 * value that genuinely differs per preserved row it resolves the ambiguity deterministically
 * rather than erroring at runtime. The cross-source `set` callers leave it off (their gate
 * already proves at-most-one partner), keeping the bare-column form byte-identical.
 *
 * `correlationAlias` qualifies each owning-PK right operand (`<pk_j>` → `<alias>.<pk_j>`).

 * qualify every conjunct only when supplied).
 *

 * `srcN` row per joined owner/partner pair, so the per-row correlated read-back
 * ({@link capturedValueSubquery}) is single-valued only when the owning side joins at most
 * one partner. The **reverse** (1:many) direction returns multiple `srcN` rows for a fixed

 *
 * The proof: collect the join's **direct** owner↔partner `column = column` equalities
 * ({@link collectCrossSideEqualities} already walks every nested ON predicate and USING
 * list across the n-way tree), gather the **partner-side** columns they pin, and check
 * whether some **unique key** of the partner table is a subset of that pinned set — fixing

 * unique keys considered: the PRIMARY KEY; every **non-partial** UNIQUE constraint; every
 * **non-partial** UNIQUE index. A **partial** unique key (one carrying a `predicate`) does
 * not bound the rows outside its predicate scope, so it does not prove global at-most-one
 * and is NOT counted. NULL semantics need no special handling — a `=` join only matches
 * non-null equal values and a unique key bounds each non-null value to ≤1 row (PK columns
 * are NOT NULL regardless).
 *
 * This is the inverse of the FK-correlation reasoning {@link edgeCorrelated} the delete
 * path uses, but **FK is not required** — the proof is purely partner-side uniqueness (the
 * canonical FK-child-reads-parent case is subsumed: the FK references the parent's PK and
 * the join equates the child's FK column to it, so the parent's PK ⊆ the pinned set).
 * **Multi-hop / transitive** cross-source (owner and partner not directly joined) pins no
 * partner column ⇒ NOT proven ⇒ the caller rejects (conservative: this only over-rejects,
 * never falsely accepts; a transitive value-determinacy proof is a possible follow-up).
