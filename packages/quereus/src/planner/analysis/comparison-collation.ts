/**
 * THE shared resolution of a comparison's *effective collation*. Both the
 * plan-time mirrors (access-path collation-cover analysis, FD/EC gates in
 * `fd-utils.ts`, the predicate normalizer's eq↔IN gate, the constraint
 * extractor's collation gates) and the runtime emitters (`emitComparisonOp`,
 * `emitIn`, `emitBetween`, the USING-join comparator) call through this module,
 * so plan-time facts and runtime behavior cannot drift.
 *
 * ## The resolution lattice
 *
 * Each operand contributes at most one `(collation, rank)`, derived from the
 * provenance of its `ScalarType.collationName` ({@link CollationSource}):
 *
 * | rank | source                                            | BINARY contributes? |
 * |------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
 * | 3    | `explicit` — a COLLATE expression                 | yes (`collate binary` is a real demand) |
 * | 2    | `declared` — column with an explicit COLLATE      | yes (`c text collate binary` is a real preference) |
 * | 1    | `default` — defaulted column collation            | **no** — a defaulted BINARY is the engine floor |
 * | —    | no `collationName` (literals, most expressions)   | n/a |
 *
 * Resolution of `left <op> right` is **symmetric** (`a = b` ≡ `b = a`):
 * 1. The highest rank present among the two contributions wins.
 * 2. If both operands contribute at that rank with *different* normalized
 *    names: rank 3 or 2 → plan-time error ({@link collationConflictError});
 *    rank 1 → BINARY, silently (defaults are preferences, not declarations).
 * 3. Otherwise the winning (single, or name-identical) contribution's name;
 *    no contributions at all → BINARY.
 *
 * This deliberately diverges from SQLite's left-operand precedence: the engine
 * follows explicit-over-implicit semantics and keeps comparisons commutative.
 * See `docs/types.md` § Comparison collation resolution.
