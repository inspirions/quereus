/**
 * Symmetric per-column LOGICAL-type merge for set operations (UNION / UNION ALL /
 * INTERSECT / EXCEPT / DIFF) — the type half of set-op output-column resolution;
 * the collation half is `resolveSetOpColumnCollation` in `comparison-collation.ts`.
 *
 * A set operation's output column carries rows from BOTH operands, so the type it
 * advertises must describe both — everything downstream trusts it (the DML write
 * pass `buildRowCoercion` skips conversion on an identity match, the set-op dedup
 * comparator keys off it, predicate coercion decides casts from it). The merge is
 * order-independent: swapping the operands can never change the result.
 *
 * Rules, first match wins (see docs/types.md § Where coercion happens):
 *  1. Identical logical types → that type (registry singletons, identity compare).
 *  2. Either side is NULL → the other side's type (a `select null` branch is a
 *     valid member of every type and must not poison a well-typed union).
 *  3. Both builtin numeric (and differing) → NUMERIC, whose value space
 *     (`number | bigint`) covers both branches as they actually are — no branch
 *     conversion needed. NOT the CASE rule ("arms differ ⇒ TEXT") — `1 union all
 *     2.5` must stay numeric; and NOT arithmetic's INTEGER + REAL → REAL, which
 *     describes one value, not a stream mixing both forms.
 *  4. Exactly one side object-physical (JSON today) → the object side's type,
 *     with the other operand marked `convert` — the same rule and direction
 *     `insertCrossTypeCoercion` applies to comparisons (casting the JSON side to
 *     text would make identity depend on spelling and diverge from the index's
 *     structural compare). The caller is responsible for actually converting the
 *     marked operand (a lenient CAST); a caller that cannot must advertise ANY
 *     instead ({@link mergeSetOpAdvertisedType}).
 *  5. Otherwise → ANY. The honest answer for a pair with no principled common
 *     type (DATE ∪ TEXT, BLOB ∪ TEXT, …): ANY's `parse` is pass-through and its
 *     `compare` is storage-class + BINARY ordering, and at a DML it is never
 *     identical to a declared column type, so every consumer converts — correct
 *     precisely because no branch is guaranteed to already be in target form.
