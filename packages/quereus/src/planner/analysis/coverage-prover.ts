/**
 * Coverage prover — recognizes when an explicit materialized view *covers* a
 * UNIQUE constraint, i.e. its materialized row set is observation-equivalent to
 * the set of rows the constraint governs, keyed so a point lookup answers the
 * uniqueness question. Pure analysis: it records a constraint↔structure link
 * (see `runtime/emit/materialized-view.ts`); **nothing enforces through the MV's
 * backing table in this ticket** (that needs row-time write-through maintenance
 * — see `docs/mv-constraints.md` § Covering structures, the soundness note).
 *
 * Shape — the body, after optimization, walks down to a single constrained base
 * table `T` through a chain of:
 *
 *     TableReference(T) → optional Filter(P) → Project(...) → optional Sort
 *
 * (physical access nodes such as IndexScan / SeqScan are transparent links in
 * the chain). A binary **join** is admitted when `T` provably contributes
 * *exactly one* MV row per governed `T` row — see the 1:1 decomposition below.
 * Aggregation, DISTINCT, set operations, `FanOutLookupJoin`, and `AsofScan` are
 * always `NotCovers('shape')`.
 *
 * Soundness is paramount: a false `Covers` would (once the lens layer routes
 * enforcement through the structure) silently miss conflicts. Every check is
 * conservative — a false `NotCovers` only forgoes an optimization.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **The 1:1 join decomposition.** "Exactly one MV row per governed `T` row"
 * splits into two independent obligations, each proven by a distinct surface:
 *
 *  - **No row loss (≥1).** Proven one of two ways during the plan walk:
 *
 *      1. *Row preservation* — `T` sits on the row-*preserving* side of the join:
 *         a `left` join with `T` in the left subtree, or a `right` join with `T`
 *         in the right subtree.
 *      2. *Referential integrity* — an `inner`/`cross` join whose equi-pairs are
 *         an inclusion dependency from the `T`-side relation to the lookup table's
 *         **primary key**, over a lookup side that exposes the parent's *full* row
 *         set (`innerJoinRetainsConstrainedTable`). Enforced RI then makes every
 *         `T` row match exactly one lookup row, so the inner join loses nothing.
 *         This obligation is now **IND-derived** (Wave 2): it first consults the
 *         propagated `PhysicalProperties.inds` surface on the `T`-side subtree
 *         (`indDerivedNoRowLoss`) and falls back to the original structural
 *         NOT-NULL-FK-on-`T` check (`lookupCoveringFK`, `!match.nullable`) when no
 *         IND discharges it. Both gate on the same preconditions, so they agree on
 *         every single-FK shape; the IND path additionally proves no-row-loss
 *         across multi-hop FK chains (`T → M → P`) whose threaded IND a single
 *         `lookupCoveringFK` call cannot see. Both lean on the engine treating
 *         declared FKs as inclusion dependencies — see the RI soundness note below.
 *
 *    Every other join type/position (`inner`/`cross` *without* a covering FK/IND;
 *    `semi`/`anti` filter; `full` injects lookup-only rows; `T` on the dropping
 *    side) is rejected as `shape`. FDs encode uniqueness, not existence, so
 *    obligation (1) cannot be FD-derived; obligation (2) is discharged from the
 *    propagated IND surface (the Wave-1 over-claim-free guarantee licenses trusting
 *    it) with the structural FK-schema read as fallback.
 *
 *  - **No fan-out (≤1).** `T`'s primary key must be a unique key of the
 *    **topmost join's output relation**, read through `isUnique`. The optimizer
 *    propagates join key-preservation into the join's `physical.fds`
 *    (`analyzeJoinKeyCoverage` → `propagateJoinFds`): for `T LEFT JOIN L on
 *    T.fk = L.ukey` it emits `T.pk → all_join_cols` *iff* the equi-pairs cover a
 *    unique key of `L`, i.e. iff each `T` row matches ≤1 `L` row. The moment the
 *    lookup side can multiply a `T` row, no preserved-key FD is emitted and
 *    `T.pk` is not a superkey of the join output ⇒ `NotCovers('fanout')`.
 *
 *    **Why the join frame, not the projected `root`.** The check is deliberately
 *    against the topmost join node, where the lookup columns are still present.
 *    A fanning `left` join still carries `T`'s own PK FD `T.pk → T-cols` (from
 *    the left input's `physical.fds`); once the lookup columns are *projected
 *    away* in `root`, that FD would make `T.pk` a derived key of the narrowed
 *    relation and silently mask the fan-out (the duplicate `T` rows survive
 *    projection without `DISTINCT`). At the join frame the retained lookup
 *    columns witness the fan-out, so `isUnique` is faithful regardless of what
 *    the projection keeps.
 *
 * Both obligations are required and neither implies the other: a `left` join to
 * a *non-unique* lookup key is row-preserving but fans out (caught by the fan-out
 * gate); an `inner` join to a unique *non-FK* (or nullable-FK) lookup key does
 * not fan out but can lose `T` rows (caught by the no-row-loss gate). A NOT-NULL
 * FK→PK inner join satisfies both at once: the FK target is the PK, so it is
 * unique (no fan-out) *and* every `T` row matches (no row loss).
 *
 * **Referential-integrity soundness (load-bearing).** Obligation (2) is sound
 * only because Quereus *enforces* referential integrity: `pragma foreign_keys`
 * defaults on, and the optimizer treats every declared FK as a hard inclusion
 * dependency (`child.fk ⊆ parent.pk` — see `util/ind-utils.ts`). The INNER
 * branch of `rule-join-elimination` already relies on exactly this invariant to
 * drop an FK→PK join, so admitting the same shape here introduces no *new*
 * assumption. If FKs were advisory — or RI is disabled and orphan child rows are
 * inserted — both this admit path *and* inner join elimination would be unsound
 * together; that is a global optimizer assumption, not one this prover owns.
 *
 * **NOT the `extractBindings` `'row'` classification.** A tempting-but-wrong
 * signal is the binding extractor's `'row'` class (`binding-extractor.ts`,
 * `analyzeRowSpecific`). That is *equality-pinned* — it fires only when equality
 * constraints cover `T`'s key at the reference, and reports a bare join scan as
 * `'global'`. The sound realization of "exactly one MV row per source row" is
 * `T`'s primary key being preserved as a key of the join output — the FD-surface
 * fact `isUnique` already consumes — so `binding-extractor.ts` needs no change.
 *
 * The v1 projection / ordering / predicate checks are frame-correct for a join
 * body: the covering columns all belong to `T` (UC + PK), the lookup-side
 * attributes simply are not in `baseAttrToCol` and are ignored, and the join `ON`
 * lives in the AST `from` clause (not `WHERE`). The AST `ORDER BY` / `WHERE`
 * column resolution is **qualifier-aware** (`makeBodyColumnResolver`): `alias.col`
 * resolves to a `T` column only when `alias` denotes `T`'s reference, and a bare
 * `col` only when unambiguous across the join's sources. A term on a lookup-side
 * column therefore fails on its own terms (`ordering-mismatch` for an `ORDER BY`,
 * `predicate-entailment` for a `WHERE`) rather than mis-mapping onto a same-named
 * `T` column — so a 1:1 join whose lookup key shares a UC column name (e.g.
 * `line_items ⋈ products on l.sku = p.sku`) now covers, instead of being rejected
 * by the former bare-name collision guard.
 *
 * **Cross-schema qualifier resolution is (schema, table)-aware.** Qualifier
 * matching keys on the reference's `(schema, table)` pair, not its table name
 * alone: a `schema.table.col` ORDER BY / WHERE term whose *table* name equals
 * `T`'s but whose *schema* denotes a different schema (e.g. a lookup `s2.t` joined
 * against base `main.t`, both named `t`) resolves to `undefined` instead of
 * collapsing onto base `T`'s same-named column and yielding a false `Covers`. This
 * is **defense-in-depth**: the binder rejects *every* 3-part `schema.table.column`
 * reference in expression context before the prover runs (see
 * `AliasedScope.resolveSymbol` / `resolveColumn`), so a real materialized view can
 * never carry such a term — the guard is reachable only by feeding `proveCoverage`
 * a hand-built `selectAst` (which is what the dedicated unit test does). The two
 * SQL-reachable orderings (`order by uc` bare, `order by t.uc` 2-part) both
 * resolve to base `T`'s column, a genuine cover, and are unchanged.
 *
 * **Join elimination, not handled here.** When the optimizer eliminates a
 * key-preserving lookup join (lookup columns unprojected + FK→PK alignment, see
 * `rule-join-elimination.ts`) the body collapses to a single-source chain and the
 * v1 path covers it with no join-specific code. This module handles the residual
 * cases where the join survives the optimizer but is still provably 1:1.
 *
 * Inner/cross covering via enforced referential integrity is handled (obligation
 * (2) above). Full-outer covering remains deferred (it injects lookup-only rows
 * that have no governed `T` row).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Two different "coverage" questions live in this module; keep them apart:
 *
 *  1. **Base-table covering** (`proveCoverage`, above) — does an explicit MV's
 *     materialized row set cover a `unique` constraint on a *base table* `T`,
 *     keyed so a point lookup answers the uniqueness question and the base PK is
 *     reconstructible so a conflicting row can be identified? Requires literal
 *     projection of every UC column + the source PK, an `order by` permutation of
 *     the UC columns, and predicate/NULL-skip alignment.
 *
 *  2. **Output-relation effective key** (`proveEffectiveKeyUnique`, below) — is
 *     the body's *own output relation* provably unique on the declared key
 *     columns, via its effective key (declared keys, FD-closure-derived keys, or
 *     the all-columns/set fallback, all read through the unified `isUnique`
 *     surface)? This is the obligation primitive the lens prover consumes for its
 *     `obligation: proved` class — e.g. a `group by x, y` body whose output is
 *     intrinsically one row per `(x, y)` vacuously satisfies a logical
 *     `unique(x, y)`, so no runtime enforcement structure is needed.
 *
 * **Why (2) is NOT folded into (1).** An FD-derived output key cannot prove a
 * *base-table* constraint, and folding it in would be unsound. A `group by x`
 * body's output is *always* unique on `x` — whether or not `T` satisfies
 * `unique(x)` — because grouping collapses base-row duplicates: two base rows
 * with `x = 5` (a base-constraint violation) still yield exactly one output row
 * for `x = 5`. Output-key uniqueness is therefore silent about base duplicates;
 * that masking is the whole problem. Aggregating bodies also drop the base PK, so
 * the "identify the conflicting base row" half of the v1 covering contract (for
 * REPLACE / IGNORE conflict resolution) is unrecoverable. (2) is thus a proof
 * about the *derived (output) relation's own* constraint, deliberately kept out
 * of `proveCoverage` to preserve the v1 soundness boundary and leave the
 * eager-link path (`linkCoveredUniqueConstraints`) untouched. Whether a covering
 * *enforcement* structure can ever be FD-derived (detection-only, ABORT) is a
 * separate concern of the row-time-enforcement / lens tickets, not this one.

 * "Body proves it": true iff the body's output relation is provably unique on

 * FD-closure-derived keys, or the set/all-columns fallback, all read through the
 * unified `isUnique` surface. This is the obligation primitive the lens prover
 * consumes for its `obligation: proved` class (e.g. a `group by x, y` body
 * proving a logical `unique(x, y)`).
 *
 * `root` MUST be the optimized body relation (the same node `proveCoverage`
 * receives: `db.getPlan(body).getRelations()[0]`), so `physical.fds` is
 * populated — the group-key FD (`propagateAggregateFds`) and projected
 * source-key FDs live there.
 *
 * Soundness notes (why the v1 base-table covering checks do NOT apply here):
 *  - Ordering: irrelevant — a proof of intrinsic uniqueness needs no ordered
 *    point-lookup path, so the canonical `group by` body (no ORDER BY) qualifies.
 *  - PK reconstructibility / observation-equivalence: irrelevant — there is no
 *    enforcement and no base row to identify; the constraint is on the output.
 *  - NULL-skip: composes trivially by subsumption. `isUnique` proves *strict*
 *    key-uniqueness (NULL treated as a value); SQL `unique` is NULL-permissive
 *    (weaker), so strict-unique ⟹ `unique` holds. No extra NULL handling.
 *  - Superkey semantics are correct: if the body's real key is a subset of
 *    `keyColumns`, the (stronger) constraint on the smaller set still implies the
 *    declared one — `isUnique` already returns true for any superset of a key.
 *
 * `keyColumns` are **body-output** column indices; the lens prover owns the
 * logical-column → output-column mapping (this primitive does no base-table
 * attribute-id translation — that was a v1 mechanism for the base frame and does
 * not apply to the output frame). Delegates uniqueness entirely to `isUnique`
 * (DRY); the value this adds is the named obligation seam, the diagnostic result
 * shape, and the load-bearing soundness documentation above.
