/**
 * Which attributes does a predicate need in scope?
 *
 * A predicate's dependencies are NOT just the column references in its own
 * scalar tree. A sub-query operand (`exists (...)`, `x in (select ...)`, a
 * scalar sub-query) hangs a RELATIONAL subtree off the scalar expression, and a
 * correlated reference inside that subtree reads an outer attribute just as
 * surely as a top-level `t.d` does. A rule that walks scalar children only sees
 * an empty dependency set for `exists (select 1 from side where t.d > 0)` and
 * will happily move the predicate below the node that defines `d`, stranding
 * the reference and failing at runtime with "No row context found for column d".
 *
 * The relational half is answered by `collectExternalReferences`, which walks
 * both `getChildren()` and `getRelations()` and subtracts everything the
 * subtree defines for itself — what remains is exactly what it reads from
 * outside.
