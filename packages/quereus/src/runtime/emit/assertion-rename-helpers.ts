// passes the target/resolver built for THAT schema's home path (over the statement's
// pre-mutation snapshot), so an unqualified `t` in a body matches only when it
// actually RESOLVES to the renamed table. An assertion in `temp` naming `main.t`
// therefore follows a rename of `main.t`, while one whose bare `t` means `temp.t`
// is left alone.

/**
 * Rewrites every assertion in `schema` after a source TABLE RENAME — the assertion
 * mirror of the plain-view loop in `propagateTableRenameInSchema` (called once per
 * schema by the caller with that schema's resolver, same in-place `renameTableInAst`
 * walk over a body that owns its own FROM scopes).
 *
 * On a changed body the derived `violationSql` is regenerated from the rewritten
 * expression (the commit-time evaluator re-parses that text, so it is the field that
 * actually carries the rename into enforcement), `dependentTables` is string-mapped
 * old base → new base, and the record is re-registered through
 * {@link Database.schemaManager} so `assertion_modified` fires — which is what
 * invalidates the optimizer's assertion-hoist cache.

/**
 * Swaps the rewritten assertion into the catalog. The CHECK expression AST was
 * already mutated in place by the caller's walker, mirroring how the view loop
 * treats `selectAst` — `oldObject` on the emitted event therefore shares the
 * rewritten AST (only the derived fields differ), which no consumer reads.
 *
 * Registration goes through `SchemaManager.addAssertion` rather than
 * `Schema.addAssertion` because only the former fires `assertion_modified`.
 *
 * NOTE: an assertion with no `checkExpression` (the schema field is optional, for
 * assertions reconstructed from persisted `violationSql` alone) is skipped by both
 * callers — there is no AST to walk. Unreachable today: nothing persists assertions
 * (`CatalogObjectKind` is `'view' | 'materializedView' | 'table'` and no store module
 * has an assertion catalog path), so every live assertion came from
 * `CREATE ASSERTION` and carries its expression. If an assertion-reconstruction path
 * is ever added, this pass needs a re-parse arm or those assertions break on rename.
 *
 * NOTE: no per-assertion try/catch, deliberately — the only plausible throw is
 * `buildAssertionViolationSql` on an AST that already stringified at create time, and
 * catching would leave `checkExpression` rewritten while `violationSql` still named
 * the old table, which is silently the very breakage this pass exists to prevent. The
 * cost is that a throw here leaves earlier assertions in the loop already rewritten
 * against a rename the statement then reports as failed (the view loop above has the
 * same exposure). If that ever becomes reachable, the fix is a dry-run probe before
 * any mutation, like `assertRenameDependentsPersistable`'s — not a catch.
