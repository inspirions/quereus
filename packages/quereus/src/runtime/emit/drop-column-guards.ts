/**
 * The `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN` guards over dependents that `runDropColumn` does not
 * otherwise see: a column DEFAULT or `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` body that names the column, a
 * CHECK constraint that names it, an assertion whose CHECK body names it, and a foreign
 * key in *another* table pointing **at** the column.
 *
 * Whether a dependent is removed with the column or blocks the drop turns on two
 * questions: is it defined by a *column set* or by an *expression*, and does it live on
 * the altered table or somewhere else?
 *
 * - **Structural** dependents **of the altered table** (a UNIQUE over the dropped column,
 *   the table's own FK using it as a child column) are defined by a *column set*. Losing
 *   a column makes them a different constraint, not a narrower one, so both vtab modules
 *   **remove them with the column**.
 * - **Expression** dependents (a generated column's expression, a partial index's
 *   `WHERE`, and — here — a column DEFAULT, a CHECK expression and an assertion body) are
 *   arbitrary user-authored logic with no narrowed form at all. The only choices are
 *   delete-it-silently and refuse, and the engine **refuses**, `StatusCode.CONSTRAINT`.
 * - **Dependents living in another table** — a foreign key whose *parent* column is the
 *   one being dropped, and (through a subquery) another table's CHECK / DEFAULT /
 *   generated body — refuse regardless of shape. Removing one would silently weaken, or
 *   outright break, a constraint on a table the user did not name in the statement.
 *
 * Refuse is right for all four guards here because it is what the two expression guards
 * already inside `runDropColumn` do (so the function gains no second policy), it is
 * SQLite's position for the whole family, and — for the assertion arm —
 * `assertNoAssertionDependsOn` already chose refuse for the *table* verb over the same
 * assertion. Cascading here would make `drop table f` and `alter table f drop column x`
 * disagree about the same object.
 *
 * The two expression guards below scan **every table in every schema**, not just the
 * altered one, via `schema/expression-dependents.ts` — a CHECK or DEFAULT may contain a
 * subquery, so another table's expression can legitimately name this column, and
 * `ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN` has always rewritten exactly those. See that module for
 * the shared walk and the seeded/unseeded probe split it turns on. All three guards follow
 * view / materialized-view bodies through the same closure
 * (`schema/object-dependency-closure.ts`), so a CHECK reaching the column only through a
 * view refuses the drop and the refusal names the chain.
 *
 * Known cost, accepted: an **unnamed** table-level CHECK cannot be dropped
 * (`DROP CONSTRAINT` resolves by name only), so refusing leaves such a column
 * undroppable short of rebuilding the referencing table — again SQLite's position. The
 * refusal message quotes the constraint's expression so the user can at least see what is
 * in the way.
 *
 * All four guards must run **before** `requireVtabModule` / `module.alterTable`, so a
 * refused statement never reaches a persisting module and the table is left untouched
 * rather than reverted.
 */

/**
 * Refuses the drop when a column DEFAULT or `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` body — on the altered
 * table or on any other table in any schema — names the column.
 *
 * A default is evaluated against the row being written, so on the altered table it names
 * its siblings through the row-image qualifier — `b integer default (new.a + 1)`.
 * Dropping `a` leaves that default uncompilable and the table unable to accept any new
 * row at all, with an error naming a column the user deliberately removed. On ANOTHER
 * table the same expression reaches this column only through a subquery
 * (`w integer default ((select min(v) from t))`), and the damage is worse: that table
 * becomes unwritable and the error names neither `t`, nor the dropped column, nor the
 * default that broke.
 *
 * "Names" is decided by {@link findColumnExpressionDependent}, which shares its walk with
 * the rename propagation — so the drop refuses exactly the references a rename would have
 * rewritten, case folding (`NEW.A`) and the `"new"`-named-table shadowing edge included,
 * and the two definitions cannot drift. That scope-awareness is load-bearing rather than
 * decorative: a default whose subquery reads a like-named column on another table
 * (`default ((select min(v) from u))`) must NOT false-refuse dropping this table's own `v`.
 *
 * Two expressions on the altered table are deliberately skipped — the dropped column's
 * own default (it goes away with the column) and every own-table generated body
 * (`runDropColumn` already refuses off `generatedColumnDependencies`). See
 * {@link findColumnExpressionDependent} for both.

/**
 * Refuses the drop when a live assertion's CHECK body, or any stored view /

 *
 * Blast radius is why this one is worth a guard at all: `AssertionEvaluator`
 * recompiles **every** live assertion on any commit that touched any table, so a
 * single body left naming a dropped column makes every write to the whole database
 * fail — including writes to tables that have nothing to do with the altered one.
 *
 * The walk is the unseeded {@link columnReferencedInAst}: an assertion body names its
 * tables explicitly in its own FROM clauses, so there is no implicit binding to seed
 * (unlike a CHECK). A body that names the table but not the column — `select *`
 * included — is not a reference and does not block the drop.
 *
 * The same probe runs over EVERY body in the assertion's reach, its own included, so
 * `create view v as select id, x from t` plus `create assertion a check (… from v
 * where x < 0)` refuses `alter table t drop column x` — the match is on `v`'s body,
 * not the assertion's.
 *
 * Each body is probed against every COLUMN REPUBLICATION target
 * (`schema/column-republication.ts`), not the base table alone: a view that
 * re-exposes the column by a star (`create view v as select * from t`, `select t.*`,
 * or a materialized view of either) spells the name nowhere, and a reader's
 * `where x < 0` references the column against `v`. Targets are swept OUTER — base
 * table first, bodies inner — so every match the base sweep finds is found at the
 * body it always was and the existing message spellings do not move. The
 * broken-listed arm follows the sweep: an explicit column list over a covering `*`
 * (`create view v(a, b) as select * from t`) breaks the whole view on the drop
 * (the star's arity changes), so an assertion whose reach names such a view at all
 * refuses, with a message saying the view breaks outright. The fixpoint's second
 * catalog snapshot is taken at the same pre-mutation point as
 * `assertionReachesHomeSchemaFirst`'s, so the two answer identically.
 *
 * Scope is EVERY schema, matching `assertNoAssertionDependsOn`: an assertion in
 * `temp` naming `main.t`'s column blocks the drop, while one whose bare `t` resolves
 * to `temp.t` does not. Each body resolves its unqualified names under its own home
 * schema path. The scan itself is {@link assertionReachesHomeSchemaFirst}, shared

/**
 * Refuses the drop when some foreign key — in any schema, this table's own included —
 * names the column among its **parent** columns.
 *
 * A foreign key stores its parent columns as *names* (`referencedColumnNames`) and
 * re-resolves them against the parent's current shape on every write
 * (`resolveReferencedColumns`, `schema/table.ts`). Dropping a named parent column therefore does not
 * break the altered table at all — it makes the *referencing* table unwritable, with an
 * error naming a column the user deliberately removed somewhere else. Refusing is the
 * only way that failure stays attached to the statement that caused it.
 *
 * The refusal is **not** gated on `pragma foreign_keys`. The pragma decides whether the
 * DML builders emit FK checks, so with it off the breakage is merely latent: the schema
 * is still wrong and turning the pragma on later bricks the child table. The guards
 * already in `runDropColumn` are likewise unconditional.
 *
 * Discovery goes through {@link SchemaManager.getReferencingForeignKeys} — the cached
 * reverse index keyed by referenced `schema.table` that `DROP TABLE`'s parent-side guard
 * already uses — rather than a fresh walk of every foreign key in every schema. Its key
 * is `fk.referencedSchema ?? childTable.schemaName`, and `referencedSchema` is populated
 * at build time from the declaration (`constraint-builder.ts`: `fk.schema ?? childSchemaName`),
 * so the bucket a key lands in is the same parent
 * `planner/building/foreign-key-builder.ts` resolves at enforcement time. That identity is
 * what makes "the guard refuses exactly the drops enforcement would have choked on" true.
 * An unqualified reference binds to the **child's own schema**, not through the session
 * search path — a cross-schema key must qualify its parent (`references main.p(c)`) or it
 * resolves to no parent at all.
 *
 * Two keys are skipped, both deliberately:
 *
 * - One with **no `referencedColumnNames`** (`references Parent` with no column list)
 *   falls back to the parent's primary key, which no name resolution can miss and which
 *   `runDropColumn` already refuses to drop. Not an oversight — there is no name here for
 *   this drop to invalidate.
 * - A **self-referencing key that this same drop removes** — one on the altered table whose
 *   *child* columns include the dropped column (`x integer references t(x)`). The module
 *   removes the whole key as part of the drop, so nothing is left pointing at the missing
 *   name. Refusing there would turn away a legal drop.
