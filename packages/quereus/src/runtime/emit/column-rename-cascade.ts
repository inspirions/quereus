/**
 * Worklist driver for `ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN` propagation. Rewriting a
 * dependent view / materialized-view body can SHIFT THE NAME the object
 * publishes (a bare passthrough projection of the renamed column — or a `*`
 * covering the target — starts publishing the new name), and the objects
 * reading IT then need the same column rename applied with the view as the
 * target. This module owns that fixpoint:
 *
 *     queue ← [ renamed table ]
 *     while queue: run the ordinary all-schema propagation for the head,
 *       then enqueue every view / MV whose published names that round shifted.
 *
 * Each round re-enters the SAME per-schema propagation
 * (`propagateColumnRenameInSchema` / `propagateColumnRenameToMaterializedViews`
 * — threaded in by `propagateColumnRename` in alter-table.ts as the `runRound`
 * callback, to avoid an import cycle), so every dependent kind the first round
 * covers — dependent tables' CHECK / DEFAULT / GENERATED expressions, views,
 * materialized views, assertions — is covered at every depth.
 *
 * The per-round dependent scan ({@link scanShiftedPublishers}) lives in
 * `schema/column-republication.ts`, shared with the DROP COLUMN guards'
 * read-only fixpoint over the same lineage.
 *
 * Views cannot be recursive and a maintained table cannot derive from itself,
 * so the visited set is insurance against a malformed catalog rather than an
 * expected cycle — but without it the loop would be unbounded.
 *
 * NOTE: each round costs a full all-schema propagation plus a full scan of every
 * schema's views and maintained tables, and the pre-flight additionally spine-clones
 * every scanned body per round — so one `RENAME COLUMN` is O(chain depth × catalog
 * size) AST walks. Depth is 1–3 for realistic catalogs and DDL is rare, so this is
 * not worth optimizing now; if a deep republishing chain over a large catalog ever
 * makes RENAME COLUMN slow, narrow each round to the objects that actually name the
 * round's target (an object-dependency index) instead of re-sweeping the catalog.

/**
 * The live cascade. Breadth-first from the renamed table: run `runRound` (the
 * ordinary all-schema column-rename propagation) for the head, then scan for
 * views / MVs whose published names that round shifted and enqueue them as the
 * next targets. Each round's rewrites land in place before the scan runs, so
 * the scan reads post-rewrite bodies — {@link import('../../schema/rename/column-rename.js').bodyExposesRenamedColumn}'s
 * documented contract.
 *
 * `preStaleMvs` is the statement's pre-notify staleness snapshot: a pre-stale
 * MV's backing columns are NOT renamed (its body may be rewritten, but only
 * REFRESH may reshape the backing — see `applyMaterializedViewRewrite`), so
 * its published names do not shift and its readers must NOT be rewritten.
 *
 * The caller runs `restoreUnaffectedMaterializedViews` once, AFTER the whole
 * cascade — not per round.

/**
 * Read-only pre-flight for the cascade, run BEFORE the statement's first side
 * effect: walks the same fixpoint the live cascade will walk — probing spine
 * clones, mutating nothing — and refuses the statement when any round would
 * leave a view / materialized view publishing TWO columns of the new name
 * (it already publishes `newCol`, and the shifted passthrough would add a
 * second). This mirrors how the base-table verb refuses a rename that
 * collides with an existing column, and it must run pre-mutation: the live
 * cascade rewrites bodies in place with no rollback, so a mid-cascade throw
 * would strand a partial rename (the same reasoning the no-catch NOTE on
 * `reregisterRewrittenAssertion` records).
 *
 * The collision test runs against the PRISTINE body: before the rename the
 * target cannot publish `newCol`, so any `newCol` already published is
 * necessarily a different column (a case-only respelling is the one rename for
 * which that premise fails, and returns below before any scan). A `newCol`
 * publication some EARLIER round created is likewise never a distinct column —
 * it can only have come from an `oldCol` publication — which is why measuring
 * the collision on the pristine body is right rather than merely convenient.
 * The exposure test runs against a throwaway
 * clone with the round's rewrite applied, matching the live driver's
 * post-rewrite contract; the pre-mutation catalog gives the same answers the
 * live rounds see because a round only rewrites references binding ITS OWN
 * target, which no other round's exposure question consults.
