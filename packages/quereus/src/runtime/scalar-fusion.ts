/**
 * Fuse a scalar function call, but only when its implementation is provably

 * contract would put a Promise check and a `.then` path on every node in the chain,
 * which is the sub-program overhead this compiler exists to delete. So the decision is
 * made once here, at emit time, in this order:
 *
 * 1. **A `customEmitter` never fuses.** It builds its own `Instruction` — possibly with
 *    sub-programs or async behavior — and this compiler cannot see inside it. Today that
 *    excludes `nullif`, `greatest`, `least`, `json_schema` and `mutation_ordinal`;
 *    giving custom emitters a fusion hook is parked in
 *    `tickets/backlog/feat-fuse-custom-emitter-scalar-functions.md`.
 * 2. **`isAsync === true` never fuses** — the author's explicit declaration.
 * 3. **A declared `async` implementation never fuses**, auto-detected, so the ordinary
 *    async UDF needs no flag.
 * 4. **Otherwise fuse, with a guard**: a non-`async` implementation that returns a
 *    Promise anyway is invisible to step 3, so the fused body checks and throws a
 *    `QuereusError` naming the function and the `isAsync` remedy. One `instanceof` per
 *    call — negligible beside the sub-program it replaces — and it converts a silent
 *    wrong answer (a Promise flowing on as if it were a value, comparing as garbage)
 *    into a loud, actionable error.
 *
 * The body itself is {@link buildScalarFunctionRun}, the same one
 * `emitScalarFunctionCallDefault` gives the scheduler, so a fused call and an
 * instruction call cannot disagree on error text, arity checking or the `REPR_STRICT`
 * return check. Operands compose by arity like every other fused node — including the
 * variadic case (`numArgs === -1`, e.g. `coalesce`), which needs no special handling
 * because the composition switches on `operands.length`, not on the declared arity.
