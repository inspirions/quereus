 * Adapts an emitter's precisely-typed `run` (e.g.
 * `(ctx, v1: SqlValue, v2: SqlValue) => SqlValue`) to the general
 * {@link InstructionRun} that the scheduler drives every instruction through.
 *
 * A specific `run` is *not* structurally assignable to `InstructionRun`. The
 * scheduler holds instructions generically and calls `run(ctx, ...args)` with
 * every arg widened to `RuntimeValue`, so a function that declares narrower
 * params (`SqlValue`, `AsyncIterable<Row>`, a fixed arity) is rejected by
 * parameter contravariance under `strictFunctionTypes` — exactly as it would be
 * if a caller passed more, fewer, or differently-typed args. Each emitter
 * therefore has to assert the conversion. This helper is the single audited home
 * for that assertion: emit sites write `run: asRun(run)` and the only
 * `as`-to-`InstructionRun` in the runtime lives here.
 *
 * `TArgs` is inferred from the `run`'s own parameter tuple, so each emit site is
 * still checked: every declared arg must be a {@link RuntimeValue} and the return
 * must be an {@link OutputValue}. Only the arity/contravariance mismatch is
 * waived. Two consequences for `run` authors:
 * - An **optional** param (`cb?: SubProgram`) types as `SubProgram | undefined`, and
 *   `undefined` is not a `RuntimeValue` — a `run` whose trailing params are
 *   conditionally emitted must declare them as a rest tuple (`...cb: SubProgram[]`),
 *   which is also the truthful description of its call sites.
 * - `Promise<OutputValue>` is a promise-of-a-promise and is *not* an `OutputValue`.
 *   An `async` `run` returns `Promise<RuntimeValue>`.
 *
 * NOTE: the per-arg checking is only as strong as `TArgs` inferring a real tuple. A
 * `run` declared `(ctx, ...args: RuntimeValue[])` infers `TArgs = RuntimeValue[]` — the
 * constraint itself — so that emit site is accepted unchecked. That is intentional for
 * the genuinely variadic emitters (`emit/block.ts`, `emit/view-mutation.ts`), but it is
 * also the escape hatch a future author reaches for to silence one of the two errors
 * above. If you widen a `run`'s params to shut up `tsc`, you have opted that emitter
 * out of checking, not fixed it.
