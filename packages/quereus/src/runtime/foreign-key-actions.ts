 * RAW proposed row would see spurious "changed" on any cell conversion normalizes —

// (cascade / set-null / set-default) — issues the propagating DML against the logical

// lens write path, so the child's own constraints + any nested logical cascade fire,
// exactly as a user-issued `delete from x.child` would. Recursion + termination work
// identically to executeSingleFKAction's SQL-issuing path: each cascade is a real
