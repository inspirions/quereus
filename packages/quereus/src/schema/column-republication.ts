/**
 * Column REPUBLICATION: which views / materialized views expose a table's
 * column as one of their own output columns — a bare passthrough projection
 * (`select x from t`), or a `*` / `t.*` whose frame binds the table.
 *
 * Two verbs consume the same lineage, which is why it lives here in `schema/`
 * rather than inside either verb's emitter:
 *
 * - `ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN` re-targets its propagation on every
 *   republisher, breadth-first, because rewriting a body shifts the name that
 *   body PUBLISHES and its readers then need the same rename with the view as
 *   the target ({@link scanShiftedPublishers}, driven by
 *   `runtime/emit/column-rename-cascade.ts`).
 * - `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN` refuses when a live rule (CHECK / DEFAULT /
 *   generated body / assertion) reads the column, and a rule can read it
 *   THROUGH a republisher without any body in the chain spelling the column's
 *   name (`create view v as select * from t` + a rule reading `v.x`). The
 *   drop guards therefore probe each reached body against every republication
 *   target ({@link collectColumnRepublication}), not against the base table
 *   alone — restoring the invariant that the drop refuses exactly the
 *   references a rename would have rewritten.

 *
 * Nothing is renamed here, so each round probes with a SENTINEL new name
 * ({@link PROBE_COLUMN_NAME} — the same trick `columnReferencedInAst` uses):
 * `probeOnClone` applies the sentinel rename to a spine clone and asks

 * under its own name, which is what its readers spell.
 *
 * The pristine catalog gives the same answers the cascade's live rounds would,
 * for the pre-flight's own reason: a round only rewrites references binding
 * ITS OWN target, which no other round's exposure question consults.
 *
 * MATERIALIZED VIEWS are treated exactly like views — `isMvExcluded` never
 * fires — deliberately CONSERVATIVE: an MV's backing columns survive the drop,
 * so a rule reading the column through the MV would in fact keep working
 * (against frozen contents, with the MV marked stale and its next
 * `refresh materialized view` failing). Refusing anyway keeps one rule for
 * both object kinds and matches what the named-projection spelling already
 * does (pinned by 41.10.2 §27) and what `DROP TABLE` does for the same object.
 * The cascade's stale-MV exclusion is rename-specific (a pre-stale MV's
 * backing columns are not renamed) and has no drop analogue, so staleness is
 * not consulted at all.
