/**
 * The catalog query "can this stored body REACH that object?", as opposed to the
 * one-hop "does this stored body NAME that object?" the rename walkers answer.
 *
 * A DROP guard that only asks the one-hop question is defeated by a view: an
 * assertion body reading `v` where `create view v as select * from t` names `t`
 * nowhere, so `drop table t` is accepted and every later write to the whole
 * database fails on an assertion whose text does not mention `t`. Reach is the
 * closure over STORED bodies — an assertion body names views and materialized
 * views, whose bodies name further views and base tables — and this module is
 * the one place that closure is computed, so the guard families that consume it
 * cannot end up disagreeing about what "reaches" means.
 *
 * Each body is walked under ITS OWN home-schema resolver, so an unqualified
 * name in a view body means what the planner would make of it *in that body*,
 * not what it would mean in the root body. That is the whole reason
 * {@link ObjectRefResolvers} is a per-home-schema factory over one snapshot.
 *
 * Scope-awareness survives the widening because the walk is
 * {@link collectTableRefsInAst}, the third sink over the very traversal the
 * rename uses: a body whose `with t as (…)` merely shadows the name still
 * contributes no reference, so the closure cannot false-refuse where the direct
 * probe already does not.

/**

 * `homeSchemaName` is the root body's OWN schema — the assertion's schema, or
 * the schema of the table carrying the CHECK / DEFAULT — because that is what
 * the root's unqualified names resolve against.
 *
 * `resolvers` is REQUIRED rather than built here, and the reason is snapshot
 * discipline (see {@link import('./object-ref-resolver.js').snapshotObjectRefResolvers}):
 * a caller looping over many roots must share ONE pre-mutation snapshot, and a
 * default would silently give each root its own.
 *
 * Termination is a visited set of object keys, so a mutually-referencing or
 * otherwise malformed catalog is walked once per object rather than forever. A
 * body naming an object that does not exist is not an error: the resolver's
 * miss→home fallback keys it stably and the expansion below simply finds
 * nothing to expand.
 *
 * `rootOpts` applies to the ROOT body's collection ONLY, never to a body
 * reached below it. Every reached body is a view / materialized-view body — a
 * relation, with no written-row context — so
 * {@link import('./rename/table-rename.js').TableRenameOpts.rowImageContext}
 * would be wrong there. It is REQUIRED at a root that is a table's CHECK
 * constraint or column DEFAULT / generated body, where a bare `new.a` names the
 * row image: rooted there without the flag, a table literally called `new`
 * would land in the reach and false-refuse its own drop
 * (`schema/expression-dependents.ts` passes it for exactly that reason). The
 * assertion guards pass nothing: an assertion CHECK owns no `new.` / `old.`
 * namespace either.
 *
 * Root-only stays correct even though a reached body CAN carry a bare unbound
 * `new.` qualifier — a `with inverse` / `with defaults` expression holds one
 * legitimately (`CREATE VIEW` accepts it there; the refs name the enclosing
 * select's output row) — because the walker suppresses those SUBTREES itself,
 * unconditionally, wherever the walk entered (`rename/table-rename.ts`,
 * `visitRowImageSubtree`). The suppression travels with the position, not with
 * this flag, so a reached view body self-suppresses and leaking `rootOpts`
 * downward would change no answer. Pinned by
 * `test/logic/41.10.4-drop-object-expression-dependents.sqllogic` (drop of a
 * table named `new` reached through a `with inverse` view).
