/**
 * Shared UNIQUE-enforcement collation helpers. {@link uniqueEnforcementCollations}
 * is the single source of truth across packages — it is re-exported from the
 * package index (`@quereus/quereus`) and reached by the store and isolation
 * re-validators (`quereus-store/store-table-constraints.ts`,
 * `quereus-isolation/isolated-table.ts`) through
 * {@link resolveUniqueEnforcementCollations}, which pairs it with the owning
 * database's collation resolver. Cross-package drift is eliminated by construction
 * rather than by a test.
 *
 * Two facts about a UNIQUE constraint that both the row-time covering-MV
 * eligibility gate and memory's covering-MV re-validation need:
 *
 *  - {@link uniqueEnforcementCollations} — the comparison collation per
 *    constrained column. For an index-derived constraint
 *    (`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX … (col COLLATE x)`) it is the index's per-column
 *    COLLATE (resolved BY NAME via `uc.derivedFromIndex`); otherwise the declared
 *    column collation. Positional alignment `uc.columns[i]` ↔ `index.columns[i]`
 *    is guaranteed by `appendIndexToTableSchema`.
 *
 *    Memory's `checkUniqueViaIndex` (manager.ts) is the one resolver that does NOT
 *    import this helper: it reads the collation from the *live* `MemoryIndex`
 *    handle that `findIndexForConstraint` returns. That resolver now looks an
 *    index-derived UC up BY NAME via `uc.derivedFromIndex` (the same key this
 *    helper uses), falling back to a column-set scan only for non-derived UCs, so
 *    the two paths agree per column even when several UNIQUE indexes cover the
 *    SAME column-set with differing collations — each UC resolves to its OWN
 *    index. This `(schema, uc)` signature still has no live `MemoryIndex` handle,
 *    so memory keeps the live-handle read rather than sharing the import; the
 *    agreement is conformance-locked by `test/unique-enforcement-collation.spec.ts`.
 *
 *  - {@link coveringMvHonorsIndexCollation} — whether a row-time covering MV may
 *    soundly answer this constraint. A covering MV generates its candidate set by
 *    re-comparing each backing row under the SOURCE column's DECLARED collation
 *    `D`, while the re-validators filter under the index per-column collation `I`.
 *    The candidate set is therefore a sound *superset* of the `I`-matches — safe
 *    to filter down — iff, per column, `D ⊒ I` (every `I`-equal pair is also
 *    `D`-equal). Two name-only tests prove `D ⊒ I` without a collation lattice
 *    (collations are opaque comparators):
 *      - `I` normalizes to BINARY — BINARY equality is byte-identity, and every
 *        comparator returns 0 for byte-identical inputs (reflexivity), so
 *        byte-identical ⊆ `D`-equal for any `D` (the finer-index case).
 *      - `D == I` (normalized names equal) — trivially `D`-equal == `I`-equal
 *        (the common case, incl. every non-derived UNIQUE where `I` falls back
 *        to `D`).
 *    Otherwise (`I` non-BINARY and ≠ `D`) the candidate set may be a *subset* and
 *    the MV must not be used as a covering structure — the per-scan / auto-index
 *    path (already index-collation-correct) enforces instead. This under-claims
 *    safely: an exotic custom pair where `D ⊒ I` holds semantically but neither
 *    test fires is declined (perf-only loss in an already-exotic shape).

 * `ucColumns` is usually a UNIQUE constraint's `uc.columns`, but any list of source

 *
 * Only semantic-ordering types are routed through `compare` ({@link hasSemanticOrdering}
 * is the gate): a TEXT/ANY column's declared `compare` honors the collation it is
 * handed and is equivalent to the generic storage-class + collation path, so the
 * cheaper generic comparator is used for them — only types whose order genuinely
 * diverges from that path need their own `compare` consulted.
 *
 * Takes PRE-RESOLVED collations rather than `(schema, uc, resolver)` because the call

 * {@link uniqueEnforcementCollations} (see the divergence note in this file's docstring;
