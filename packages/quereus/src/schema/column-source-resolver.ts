/**
 * The catalog-backed {@link ResolveColumnInSource} every scope-aware walk over a
 * schema-object expression consults to tell an unqualified reference that binds to an
 * inner FROM source from one that binds to the table under consideration.
 *
 * Four callers, one definition, so no two of them can disagree about what a name
 * resolves to: `runRenameColumn`'s pre-flight probe and its real propagation, the
 * DROP COLUMN guards (`runtime/emit/drop-column-guards.ts` and
 * `schema/expression-dependents.ts`), and the constraint planner's self-qualifier
 * strip (`planner/building/constraint-builder.ts`).
 *
 * A source may be a TABLE (a maintained table included — its backing columns are
 * real) or a VIEW. A view exposes a column when its explicit column list names it,
 * or — with no list — when its body publishes it ({@link bodyPublishesColumnNamed}:
 * a result-column alias, a bare projection, or a `*` / `t.*` / `a.*` over a source
 * that exposes it — a FROM alias only changes which qualifier names the source, so
 * `select * from t a` publishes exactly what `select * from t` does). The view arm
 * recurses through this same resolver, so a view over a
 * view answers too; views cannot be recursive, so the per-question in-flight set is
 * insurance against a malformed catalog, the same role the visited set plays in
 * `reachableObjects`.
 *
 * Resolves against the LIVE catalog on every call, so sharing one instance across
 * passes does not by itself freeze the answer between them — see the rename
 * pre-flight's comment for why its two passes agree anyway. The view arm's
 * unqualified names likewise resolve LIVE down the view's home schema path
 * ({@link Database._homeSchemaPath}), matching how the view body plans.
 *
 * NOTE: deliberately NO cross-call memo. The rename propagation shares one
 * instance across its pre-flight and its live cascade rounds, and the rounds
 * rewrite view bodies in place — a memoized "does view X expose col?" answer taken
 * before a round would be stale after it. The per-question in-flight set bounds the
 * recursion instead. The one hot-ish caller is `constraint-builder.ts` at
 * plan-build time, where the view arm only runs for a CHECK whose subquery FROMs a
 * view; if that ever profiles hot, add a cross-call memo guarded by a catalog
 * generation counter.
