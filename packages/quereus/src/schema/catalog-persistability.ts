 *
 * This exists because view/MV catalog persistence is otherwise **advisory**. It
 * runs through `SchemaChangeNotifier`, which wraps each listener in try/catch and
 * only logs, and a store module then chains the write onto an async queue with its
 * own `.catch`. So a definition the store cannot encode (today: an unpaired
 * surrogate in the name, in a column name, or in a string literal in the body)
 * would create successfully, be queryable for the session, and then be silently
 * absent after reopen. Neither swallow layer can be tightened without making an
 * unrelated listener failure abort user DDL — hence a synchronous veto at
 * statement-execution time, on a path whose throw propagates.
 *
 * Call it BEFORE the registering mutation (or inside a caller's existing rollback
 * arm) so a rejection leaves the statement a clean no-op. Modules that would not
 * persist the object no-op; see {@link VirtualTableModule.assertCatalogObjectPersistable}.

// NOTE: clones and re-renders the body of every view and maintained table, and the

// small, so this is not worth caching today; if a schema-heavy workload ever shows up
// hot here, gate the clone on a cheap dry-run name scan (or thread the prospective object
// through to the propagation instead of rebuilding it). Costs nothing at all when no
// module can veto (the early return below) — a memory-only database never pays it.
//
// NOTE: round-1-only by design. The column-rename propagation is a CASCADE (a view whose
// PUBLISHED name shifts re-runs the propagation with the view as the target — see
// runtime/emit/column-rename-cascade.ts), but this probe vets only the direct rewrites of
// the renamed table's round. Simulating the whole cascade here would mean running the
// fixpoint twice or vetoing after the catalog swap — the latter inventing a partial-rename
// failure mode the engine does not have. And it is unnecessary: the only thing a module
// refuses is an unencodable name / literal, and every cascade round introduces the SAME
// `newCol` string the statement already vets (this probe on any round-1 body it changes,
// and the module's own alterTable/renameColumn guard on the renamed table itself), so a
// cascaded body can only be unpersistable for a reason that predates the statement.
// Revisit if the veto hook ever grows a check that depends on the body as a whole rather
