	/**
	 * Adopts a schema change that was applied to the table while THIS layer's transaction

	 * Three kinds of change reach here:
	 *
	 *  - **Additive** (`create index` / `create unique index` / `add constraint … unique`):
	 *    a name absent from {@link secondaryIndexes} is built and added. Without it, a layer
	 *    created before the DDL keeps its creation-time schema: it has neither the new
	 *    `IndexSchema` (so an index scan raises "Secondary index not found") nor the derived
	 *    `uniqueConstraints` entry (so `checkUniqueConstraints` silently skips it and a
	 *    colliding insert is accepted).
	 *  - **Re-keying** (`alter column … set collate`, or an `alter column … set data type` that
	 *    keeps the physical storage class but moves to a differently-ordering logical type —
	 *    text ↔ timespan, where 'PT1H' and 'PT60M' are one value): an index whose `IndexSchema`
	 *    object is no longer the one this layer holds is REPLACED.
	 *    `BaseLayer.rebuildAllSecondaryIndexes` hands every index a fresh BTree under the new
	 *    comparator, so a layer that kept its old `MemoryIndex` would go on comparing the old way
	 *    over an orphaned tree — and, once it becomes the committed head at commit, would shadow
	 *    the base's rebuilt structures entirely. The retype has no index-column field to change
	 *    (an index column carries no logical type; it reads the column's), so
	 *    `MemoryTableManager.alterColumn` rebuilds the `IndexSchema` objects purely to raise this
	 *    signal — see its `structuresRekeyed` branch.
	 *  - **Removal** (`drop index` / `drop constraint`): an index whose name the new schema no
	 *    longer declares is DROPPED from {@link secondaryIndexes}. Without it the layer keeps the
	 *    derived `uniqueConstraints` entry in its frozen schema and goes on enforcing a constraint
	 *    that no longer exists, and an index scan can still reach the orphaned tree via
	 *    {@link getSecondaryIndexTree}. An empty/undefined `newSchema.indexes` drops all of them.
	 *    Like the additive side, a removal is NOT undone by `rollback to savepoint`: every layer in
	 *    the chain adopts it, so the restored snapshot has the index dropped too (DDL is not
	 *    transactional here — see `feat-ddl-transaction-capability`).
	 *
	 * An index is considered unchanged only when the NEW schema's `IndexSchema` is the very
	 * object the old schema carried. Every DDL path that re-keys rebuilds those objects, and
	 * every additive path preserves them, so identity is the exact discriminator.
	 *
	 * The caller MUST apply this to a whole parent chain oldest-first: each layer builds its
	 * `MemoryIndex` over its parent's tree for that index, so the parent's must already be the
	 * new one. Only the layer's OWN writes are re-indexed — everything below is inherited
	 * copy-on-write, exactly as {@link initializeSecondaryIndexes} does at construction.
	 *
	 * Never applied to a column-set or primary-key change: either would invalidate
	 * {@link pkFunctions} and the primary tree. A PK-column collation change goes to
	 * {@link rekeyPrimaryKey} instead, a column-set change (`add column` / `drop column`) to
	 * {@link prepareReshapedColumns} / {@link installReshapedColumns}, and
	 * `ensureSchemaChangeSafety` raises BUSY when any connection other than the DDL issuer
	 * holds a pending layer.

	 * {@link pkFunctions}, the primary tree, and every secondary index (each of which derives
	 * its `primaryKeyComparator` / `encode` from the PK definition), so nothing this layer owns
	 * survives the ALTER still keyed under the old collation.
	 *
	 * Like {@link adoptSchema}, the caller MUST apply this to a whole parent chain oldest-first
	 * (base layer already re-keyed): the new tree inherits copy-on-write from the parent's new
	 * one, so the parent's must already exist.
	 *
	 * ### Why {@link ownWrites} is rewritten to its net effect
	 *
	 * `ownWrites` is an ordered log that may touch one key repeatedly, and under the new
	 * comparator two keys that were distinct in that log can collapse into one. Replaying it
	 * verbatim would let a later write land on an earlier write's row, or a deletion remove a
	 * row a subsequent upsert had already placed. So the log is REWRITTEN here, in place, to
	 * one entry per key: the layer's effective row (read out of the pre-rekey tree), or a
	 * deletion — deletions first, and a deletion whose key an upsert now occupies is dropped
	 * entirely. The rewritten log is what every later reader of it replays: this method's own
	 * index rebuild, a `create index` later in the same transaction ({@link adoptSchema} →
	 * {@link reindexOwnWrites}), and `MemoryTableManager.commitTransaction`'s rebase.
	 *
	 * Soundness rests on a precondition `MemoryTableManager.validateRekeyedPrimaryKey` enforces
	 * before any of this runs: NO layer in the chain — base included — holds two rows that
	 * collide under the new comparator. Given that, every key here resolves to at most one row
	 * in the parent, so a deletion removes exactly the row this layer removed and an upsert
	 * lands at exactly one key.
	 *
	 * The deletion replay verifies, under the OLD comparator, that the row it finds is the row
	 * it removed (see {@link installNetOwnWrites}'s `deletionTargets`). Without that check a
	 * deletion whose old key collapses onto a DIFFERENT row's new key deletes that other row:
	 * stage an upsert at key `'a'` in one layer, delete the colliding `'A'` from a LATER layer,
	 * and the later layer's replayed deletion lands on the parent's `'a'` — silently removing
	 * the row the transaction just wrote. `validateRekeyedPrimaryKey`'s chain walk refuses any
	 * chain that holds a colliding pair before this method runs, which makes a cross-row land
	 * unreachable today — the verify is insurance, so the replay's own correctness does not
	 * hinge on that caller-side pass staying exactly as conservative as it is.

	 * row landing elsewhere also emits a deletion of that parent image's new key.
	 *
	 * Soundness of the per-write collapse rests on the same precondition as
	 * {@link rekeyPrimaryKey}'s: `MemoryTableManager.validateRekeyedPrimaryKey` has proven no

	 * Adopts an `alter column … set data type` / `set not null` backfill conversion applied while

	 * into every own-written row at `colIndex`, so the rest of the transaction — and, at commit, the
	 * committed head — read the new value instead of the raw one the transaction wrote. This is what
	 * fills the transaction's OWN pending NULL rows for SET NOT NULL backfill, which live in this
	 * layer, not the base.
	 *
	 * NON-primary-key column, or a key column whose bytes are unchanged. `MemoryTableManager.alterColumn`
	 * rejects any retype of a key column before any mutation, and SET NOT NULL leaves the key
	 * bytes intact, so the primary key encoding is unchanged: {@link pkFunctions} and the primary tree
	 * keep their keys, and only the value at `colIndex` moves. (Contrast {@link rekeyPrimaryKey}, which
	 * must rebuild the tree because the keys themselves change.)
	 *
	 * Subsumes {@link adoptSchema} for a same-storage-class retype that ALSO moves the comparator
	 * (text → date/timespan): `tableSchemaAtCreation` is swapped to `newSchema` and every secondary
	 * index is rebuilt from scratch against it below, so the layer's structures pick up the new
	 * comparators along with the converted values.
	 *
	 * Like {@link adoptSchema} / {@link rekeyPrimaryKey}, the caller MUST apply this oldest-first
	 * (base already converted): the layer's copy-on-write base inherits the parent's already-converted
	 * rows, so only this layer's OWN writes are rewritten here.
	 *
	 * `ownWrites` is collapsed to its net per-key effect (as {@link rekeyPrimaryKey} does) so an
	 * intermediate value a later write overwrote never reaches `convert`, and the rewritten log —
	 * carrying converted values — is what the rebase (`MemoryTableManager.rebaseLayerOntoHead`) and
	 * any later `create index` ({@link reindexOwnWrites}) replay.
	 *
	 * NULL own-values pass through untouched UNLESS `convertNulls` is set (the SET NOT NULL backfill
	 * maps null → DEFAULT). A value that fails to convert is left as-is (not an error): the manager
	 * validated every value in the effective VIEW before calling, so an unconvertible own value here is
	 * one a higher layer has shadowed — it is never read through this layer, and re-converting it would
	 * double-fault a value the transaction cannot see. It matches the base rewrite's same-reasoned skip.
