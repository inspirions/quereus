 * — the engine does not coerce read rows, because doing so would cost per row on every
 * scan for no gain on a conforming module. Concretely (full rules in `docs/types.md`
 * § Physical representation):
 *
 * - a whole number is a JS `number` while its magnitude stays inside the safe-integer
 *   range (|v| ≤ 2^53 − 1) and a `bigint` only outside it — one form per value, both
 *   directions. `BigInt(x)` around a small integer is the common way to get this wrong;
 *   `canonicalizeInteger` / `canonicalizeSqlValue` (`util/numeric-canonical.ts`) are
 *   exported to get it right;
 * - an INTEGER or TIMESTAMP column holds `number`/`bigint` by that rule, REAL holds
 *   `number`, TEXT and the string temporals (DATE/TIME/DATETIME/TIMESPAN) hold `string`,
 *   BLOB holds `Uint8Array`, BOOLEAN holds `boolean`, JSON holds a native object/array or
 *   a JSON scalar. `null` is always allowed here — nullability is enforced separately;
 * - an `ANY` column is bound by the numeric rule only.
 *
 * This is a contract, not a capability: there is no flag to declare it and no alternate
 * code path for a module that does not honor it. A module that returns a non-conforming
 * value produces answers that are right today and subtly wrong under a later
 * representation-sensitive change. Verify with `QUEREUS_REPR_STRICT=1`, which checks every
 * scanned row against the declared column types and throws naming the module, table,
 * column and type (`runtime/strict-representation.ts`). The same obligation applies to the
 * rows a module reports back from `update()`.

	 * the object is registered (or, for a materialized view, inside `materializeView`'s
	 * existing rollback arm), so a rejection leaves the statement a clean no-op.
	 *
	 * Why a veto instead of an error on the persist itself: catalog persistence for
	 * views and materialized views is **advisory / fire-and-forget** — it rides the
	 * `SchemaChangeNotifier`, whose listeners are wrapped in try/catch, and a store
	 * module chains the actual write onto an async queue. Neither layer can surface a
	 * failure to the statement, so an unpersistable definition would otherwise appear
	 * to succeed and then vanish on reopen. This hook is the ONE synchronous point where
	 * a module can refuse. See `docs/view-persistence.md`.
	 *
	 * Every registered module gets the veto, and one that would not persist `object` must
	 * no-op: views and materialized views are not owned by any one module the way a table
	 * is, and the `'table'` kind is likewise offered to every module regardless of who owns
	 * the table. Synchronous by contract: the check must be a pure function of the schema
	 * (no IO) — so a module answering for `'table'` must decide ownership from what it
	 * already holds in memory, not by reading its catalog. Omit ⇒ never consulted (today's
	 * behavior).
	 *
	 * Call sites, each ahead of its statement's first side effect: `emitCreateView`
	 * (before `schema.addView`); `materializeView` (inside its existing rollback arm — an
	 * MV's DDL text does not exist until the derivation is attached); the two view/MV SET
	 * TAGS paths in `SchemaManager` (tags ride the persisted DDL); and both ALTER RENAME
	 * arms in `runtime/emit/alter-table.ts`, which reach this through
	 * `assertRenameDependentsPersistable` — the pre-flight scan that offers the
	 * PROSPECTIVE (rewritten-on-a-clone) body of every dependent view / materialized view
	 * and the prospective record of every dependent TABLE (the FK / CHECK / partial-index
	 * rewrites a rename propagates into other tables), plus, for a renamed materialized
	 * view, its own prospective record under the new name.
	 *
	 * `'table'` is a RENAME-propagation kind only: `create table` is not gated here, since
	 * it goes through `module.create`, whose failure already reaches the statement.
	 *
	 * Not covered: a `select *` materialized view's persisted backing COLUMN LIST shifts
	 * under a column rename with no AST change and no persist event, so nothing asks here
