/**
 * Result of a VirtualTable.update() operation.

 *
 * `row` present means a row really was written/removed; absent means nothing
 * changed and the executor skips the post-write pipeline entirely. For an
 * INSERT/UPDATE it is the row the module STORED — the proposed values after the
 * module's own coercion to the declared column logical types — and the DML
 * executor reports it, not the proposed row, to every post-write consumer. For a
 * DELETE only its presence is read, never its contents. See
 * `VirtualTable.update`'s doc comment for the module-author contract and
 * docs/runtime.md § per-row post-write pipeline.
 *
 * Two REPLACE-displacement channels, both consumed by the DML executor so the
 * single post-write pipeline (change-tracking, row-time MV maintenance, FK
 * cascade, auto-events) runs uniformly across substrates:
 *
 * - `replacedRow` — the row displaced at the *same PK* by a PK-collision REPLACE.
 *   The executor models it as an update-in-place of that PK slot (an
 *   `update(replacedRow → newRow)` on the INSERT path, a `delete(replacedRow)` on
 *   the UPDATE move path), firing FK actions as a *delete* of the old image.
 * - `evictedRows` — rows at *other PKs* fully removed because REPLACE resolved a
 *   non-PK UNIQUE conflict for this same `update()` call, in user-facing schema
 *   (no overlay tombstone column). The executor models **each** as a full DELETE
 *   (`_recordDelete` + row-time maintenance + `executeForeignKeyActions('delete')`
 *   + a delete auto-event), fired **before** the new row's own bookkeeping to match
 *   the substrate's evict-then-write journal order.
 *
 * Both fields are optional and additive: a module that reports neither behaves
 * exactly as a module would have before they existed. `replacedRow` and
 * `evictedRows` are independent and may both be present in principle (today's
 * memory/store INSERT paths short-circuit on a PK collision before the secondary
 * UNIQUE check, so they do not co-occur there — but the executor handles both
 * cleanly regardless).
