/**
 * Build a `'residual-recompute'` plan for a single-source aggregate body
 * (`select g1,…, agg(…) from T [where P] group by g1,…` over **bare** group columns),
 * or return `null` on a shape mismatch (the caller falls through to the full-rebuild
 * floor). Each changed source row belongs to exactly one group `(g1,…)`; maintaining the
 * MV means recomputing that group's backing row from live state — delete the old slice,
 * run the group-keyed residual, upsert the recomputed slice (zero rows when the group
 * emptied). See {@link ResidualRecomputePlan} and `docs/incremental-maintenance.md`
 * § residual-recompute.
 *
 * A **non-deterministic** group/aggregate expression is the one hard reject (the
 * arm-specific determinism diagnostic must survive); every other mismatch — a scalar
 * aggregate, a computed group key, a backing key that is not the group key — returns
 * `null` → the floor.
 *
 * NOTE: the group binding is derived **directly** from the aggregate node's bare GROUP
 * BY columns, not via `extractBindings`. `analyzeRowSpecific`'s `'group'` classification
 * additionally requires the group key to cover a *source* unique key (so it reports
 * `'global'` for the common `group by <non-key>` body), which is the wrong test here —
 * the backing is keyed by the group key regardless of whether it is a source key.

/**
 * Build the {@link DeltaAggregateDescriptor} for a single-source aggregate body, or
 * return `undefined` when any column fails the delta eligibility gate (the arm then
 * stays a plain residual — a gate failure is never an error). Function-generic by
 * construction: every judgment reads the aggregate call node's registry-resolved
 * schema and its DECLARED {@link AggregateAlgebra} — never an aggregate-name list.
 *
 * The gate, per stored backing column:
 *  - a **group-key passthrough** column must resolve (transitively) to a GROUP BY
 *    source column that also backs a backing-PK position (so its flush value is the
 *    group key itself);
 *  - a directly **delta-maintainable aggregate** column must be a plain call (`agg(x)` /
 *    `agg()` — no DISTINCT, FILTER, ORDER BY, multi-arg) whose declared algebra has
 *    `merge` + `negate` + `decode`, with a **bare source column** argument (the delta
 *    steps the raw value);
 *  - **exact value domain**: the aggregate's declared return type is INTEGER-physical
 *    (count-shaped — exact regardless of argument), OR its argument column's static
 *    type is INTEGER-physical (integer sum). A REAL/NUMERIC/TEXT sum drifts under
 *    repeated add/subtract and would diverge byte-exactly from the live re-evaluation
 *    the oracle compares against — such a column disqualifies the whole MV (residual);
 *  - a **tighten-only** column (min/max, and any UDAF whose merge is a join-semilattice
 *    like `bit_or`/`bool_or`) — a plain call declaring `merge` + `decode` but NO `negate`
 *    — is admitted with `deltaClass: 'tighten'`. It needs no exact-value-domain gate
 *    (merge is idempotent selection, not accumulating arithmetic → no drift) and is never
 *    retraction-safe: an insert `merge`s the new value in cheaply, but a retracted group
 *    re-derives wholesale from the residual (via the descriptor's `hasTighten`) rather
 *    than trusting the arithmetic;
 *  - a **decomposition-maintained** column (the avg class) — a plain call whose algebra
 *    declares `decompose` (a scalar formula over sibling partials, e.g. avg ≡ sum/count)
 *    but is not itself directly maintainable — is admitted only when EVERY partial it
 *    names ({@link resolveDecomposePartial}) is also stored as a sibling column of this
 *    same body and is itself delta-maintainable. It carries no independent accumulation;
 *    at flush its value is `combine([finalized(partial) …])`. If any partial is missing
 *    or not delta-maintainable the whole MV falls to residual (avg is the first client of
 *    this class, not a special case);
 *  - any other column shape (a constant, an expression over the group key, …) fails.
 *
 * Whole-body requirements:
 *  - **no post-aggregate filter** (HAVING, or an outer WHERE over the aggregate
 *    output): such a filter breaks the arithmetic invariant "stored row == the
 *    group's full accumulator" — a filtered-out group has contributions but no
 *    stored row, so a later delta would rebuild it from the identity and understate
 *    the aggregate. The residual re-evaluates the filter per group and stays exact;
 *  - a **count(*) multiplicity witness** — a zero-arg delta-maintainable column with
 *    `decodeExact` (its stored value must reconstruct exactly, since it decides group
 *    emptiness under retraction). Without it, emptiness cannot be told from an
 *    all-NULL sum;
 *  - **BINARY collations** on every backing-PK (group key) column: the flush's stored-
 *    row read is the host's `scanEffective` equality-prefix seek, whose prefix compare
 *    is binary (scan-layer.ts). Unlike the prefix-delete arm there is no source-PK
 *    uniqueness collapsing collation classes to one byte form here, so a non-BINARY
 *    group key could miss a collation-equal / byte-different stored row — residual
 *    instead;
 *  - a body WHERE (if any) must compile to a single-source-row predicate
 *    (`compilePredicate`) so per-row contributions can be scoped exactly.
 *
 * Per-column `retractionSafe` (see {@link DeltaAggregateColumn}) is recorded rather
 * than gated: a not-retraction-safe descriptor still serves the bulk-insert fast path,
 * and the flush re-derives only the retracted groups through the residual.
