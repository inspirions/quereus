/**
 * Materialized-view maintenance: schema-change staleness tracking plus row-time
 * write-through maintenance.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 *  1. **Staleness** — a *schema* change to a source table (drop / alter) can break
 *     an MV's body. This manager subscribes to schema-change events and marks any
 *     MV whose body reads a modified/removed source `stale`. The next reference
 *     re-validates the body (erroring with the staleness diagnostic on an
 *     incompatible change); the next successful refresh clears the flag. One
 *     carve-out: a **body-irrelevant** `table_modified` (constraint/stats/tags-only —
 *     columns and physical PK identical, see `isBodyIrrelevantTableChange`) instead
 *     RECOMPILES each live dependent's row-time plan in place
 *     (`tryRecompileMaterializedViewLive`, gated by shape re-derivation), falling
 *     back to mark-stale on any failure — so DROP/ADD/RENAME CONSTRAINT and ANALYZE
 *     no longer de-liven dependents whose backing shape is unaffected. The SAME
 *     subscription also rebuilds a maintained table's compiled **derived-row
 *     constraint validator** when a *constraint-only* dependency — an FK parent or a
 *     subquery-CHECK target, neither a derivation source — is renamed/dropped/re-created
 *     (see {@link MaterializedViewManager.rebuildConstraintValidatorsFor}); without
 *     this the validator, compiled once at registration, would keep resolving against
 *     the dead/renamed incarnation and fail maintenance writes with an internal
 *     module-connect error.
 *
 *  2. **Row-time write-through** (`maintainRowTime`) — the backing table is kept
 *     consistent *synchronously* with each source row-write, driven from the
 *     runtime DML boundary (not at COMMIT). Each MV's maintenance is **cost-gated with a
 *     floor**: the builder matches the body to a bounded-delta arm (the covering-index
 *     inverse projection, an aggregate / lateral-TVF / 1:1-join residual) when one fits —
 *     each source row then maps to a bounded backing delta, no full scan — and otherwise
 *     falls through to the always-correct **full-rebuild floor** (re-evaluate the whole
 *     body, replace the backing). **No body is rejected for its shape;** the only
 *     create-time rejections are non-shape (non-determinism, bag/no-key, no relational
 *     output, and a full-rebuild-only body over a source past the size threshold). The
 *     write targets the backing table's *pending* transaction layer through the same
 *     connection a `select` from the MV uses, so the change is visible mid-transaction
 *     (reads-own-writes) and is committed/rolled-back in lockstep with the source write by
 *     the coordinated commit (see {@link MaterializedViewManager.buildMaintenancePlan}).

	 *
	 * **Same-object payload contract (load-bearing coupling).** Passing the SAME object

	 * {@link BackingRowChange} the write produced is routed back through this method,

	 * `cache` is the optional per-statement {@link BackingConnectionCache}: when the

	 *
	 * `deferred` is the optional per-statement deferred-rebuild set (MV keys) and
	 * `residualBatch` the optional per-statement residual key batch. A `'full-rebuild'`
	 * plan re-evaluates the WHOLE body, so applying it per source row is O(rows × body) —
	 * pathological; when the DML boundary supplies a `deferred` set it is instead marked

	 * recomputes whose per-row apply costs a scheduler run each; when the DML boundary
	 * supplies a `residualBatch`, they accumulate their affected binding keys (deduped
	 * across the statement) and recompute once per distinct key at the same flush.
	 * `'inverse-projection'` alone stays per-row-immediate: its delta is a cheap pure
	 * projection AND the covering-UNIQUE enforcement scan depends on its per-row backing
	 * visibility ({@link lookupCoveringConflicts} reads only inverse-projection backings,
	 * so deferring the other arms cannot starve that scan —
	 * {@link findRowTimeCoveringStructure} declines them). A cold caller without the

	 *    through the privileged `BackingHost` surface, which never touches the change log,
	 *    so without this the changed set after `insert into <source>` names only the source,
	 *    never overlaps `{main.mv}`, and the assertion is silently never dispatched.
	 *  - **Watchers.** `analyzeChangeScope` projects an MV reference to its **direct**
	 *    sources (`buildSourceUnionScope`), which is one level deep — for `mv2` over `mv1`
	 *    over `w` the projection is a watch on the (previously never-change-logged) `mv1`.
	 *    Recording makes `main.mv1` a real changed base so `mv2`'s watcher fires.
	 *
	 * Keyed on `plan.mv.primaryKeyDefinition` — the SAME object `AssertionEvaluator` reads
	 * (`_findTable(base).primaryKeyDefinition`), so the two never disagree on which columns
	 * form a row's identity. `plan.backingPkDefinition` is that same key with each column's
	 * collation *function* resolved (`resolveBackingPkColumns`); it would give identical
	 * indices, but keying off the evaluator's own source keeps the agreement structural
	 * rather than coincidental.
	 *
	 * Bounded by the realized per-statement delta, exactly like user DML: the bulk fills
	 * (`materializeView` create-fill, `rebuildBacking` refresh) write the host directly and
	 * never route through {@link postApplyBackingChanges}, and a value-identical upsert
	 * reports no {@link BackingRowChange} at all, so a no-op maintenance records nothing.
	 * Savepoints need no special handling — `_record*` writes the current change-log layer,
	 * which `ROLLBACK TO` discards.
	 *
	 * One DDL-scale exception: `attachMaintainedDerivation` writes the ATTACHED table
	 * directly (unrecorded) but deliberately cascades its whole-set reconcile delta onward
	 * (`materialized-view-helpers.ts` § "Cascade the GENUINE reconcile changes"), so a
	 * CONSUMER maintained table records one entry per reconciled row for that one statement.
	 * That is the intent — the consumer's content genuinely changed, so an assertion over it
	 * should see the attach — but it is O(consumer rows) in a single transaction.
	 *
	 * Deliberately NOT gated on the ingestion seam's `captureChanges` facet
	 * (`Database.ingestExternalRowChanges`): that flag governs the rows the CALLER reports
	 * (already accounted for at the origin), while these are the engine's own derived
	 * writes, which no external caller can have captured. See `docs/mv-ingestion.md`.

	 * permutation of the UC columns and that they seed the leading backing-PK columns
	 * (`computeBackingPrimaryKey`). So the leading `k = uc.columns.length` backing-PK
	 * columns are exactly the UC columns (as a set, possibly reordered by `order by`).
	 * The returned prefix is keyed in **backing-PK column order** (not `uc.columns`
	 * order), so a permuting `order by` still seeks to the right block:
	 * `prefix[i] = newRow[ sourceCol(backingPkDefinition[i]) ]`.
	 *
	 * Returns `undefined` (full-scan fallback) when any holds:
	 *  - fewer than `k` backing-PK columns, or a leading column is not a passthrough
	 *    of a source column (defensive — the covering shape guarantees passthrough);
	 *  - the leading `k` backing-PK columns do not map to **exactly** the UC
	 *    source-column set (defensive guard against a non-UC-leading structure);
	 *  - any leading backing-PK column, or its source UC column, has a **non-BINARY**
	 *    collation. This is a *soundness* gate, not a perf choice: the scan request
	 *    carries no collation names, so the prefix seek's early-termination resolves its
	 *    comparators at the BINARY floor (`resolveScanComparators`), while the
	 *    backing btree orders the PK by its declared collation and the UNIQUE
	 *    constraint conflicts by the source collation. Under a non-binary collation
	 *    the binary early-termination could `break` before a collated-equal /
	 *    binary-different conflict, missing it. The full-scan fallback re-compares
	 *    with the source collation, so it stays collation-correct.
	 *
	 * DESC-leading prefixes are admitted: equality on a column makes its order
	 * direction irrelevant to *grouping* (the binary-equal rows stay contiguous), and

	 * for either direction (verified by the `order by … desc` enforcement test).
