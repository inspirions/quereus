 * ({@link MaterializedViewManager.buildJoinResidualPlan}):
 *  - **`T`-only predicate** — no extra machinery. The forward (`T`) residual already injects
 *    + applies the WHERE (an out-of-scope `T` row recomputes to zero residual rows ⇒ its
 *    delete-without-upsert removes the backing row), and a `T`-column predicate cannot move
 *    the membership set `{ T : T.fk = P.pk }`, so the lookup side stays **upsert-only**
 *    (`lookupMembershipResidualScheduler` absent) — sound for the same reason the no-WHERE
 *    arm is.
 *  - **`P`-referencing predicate** (or both sides) — a `P` write can flip a row's WHERE truth
 *    and so add/remove a backing row, which upsert-only could never delete. The lookup side
 *    becomes **delete-capable**: `lookupMembershipResidualScheduler` is the body with
 *    `injectKeyFilter` on `P` but the WHERE **stripped** (membership only). Per affected `P`

 * applied **immediately** to the cached connection's pending transaction layer, so a later
 * same-statement row's enforcement scan (`lookupCoveringConflicts`) still observes every
 * earlier row's backing write. The **residual** arms and the **full-rebuild** floor are
 * instead deferred to a single end-of-statement
 * {@link MaterializedViewManager.flushDeferredMaintenance} (tracked in the per-statement
 * {@link ResidualKeyBatch} / dirty set, not this cache) — sound because only an
 * inverse-projection MV can serve as a covering structure, so no enforcement scan depends
 * on a deferred arm's per-row visibility. See `docs/mv-maintenance.md` § Synchronous,
 * transactional, per-statement. Because the cache is scoped to one generator run, the
 * connection it holds cannot be torn down mid-statement; the cold enforcement/eviction
 * paths that omit the cache re-resolve the *same* connection deterministically, so
 * reads-own-writes is unaffected.
