/**
 * Filter conjunct early exit (runtime/emit/filter.ts `emitFilter`).
 *
 * A conjunctive WHERE/HAVING predicate is split into its top-level AND conjuncts at
 * emit time; each becomes its own sub-program and they run in source order, stopping
 * at the first one that does not yield true. This suite pins:
 *
 *  1. Later conjuncts genuinely do not run for a row an earlier conjunct rejected —
 *     proven by a counting scalar UDF (the count must be per-surviving-row, which
 *     distinguishes early exit from both eager-every-row and hoist-once).
 *  2. Row-set parity: splitting changes evaluation counts only, never results.
 *     Truthiness of a conjunct (blob / string / 0 / '' / bigint) must match the
 *     unsplit single-conjunct path byte for byte.
 *  3. The emit shape: a single-conjunct predicate keeps the exact pre-split
 *     instruction and note; only N > 1 takes the early-exit path.
 *
 * Evaluation *ordering* (putting the cheap conjunct first) is deliberately NOT this
 * suite's job — that is `rule-filter-conjunct-ordering` (PostOptimization), covered
 * by where-conjunct-ordering.spec.ts. One cross-check below pins that the two
 * features compose: an expensive conjunct written first is reordered behind the
 * cheap one and then early-exited like any other.
