/**
 * The spelling × verb matrix for the column verbs' scope walk
 * (`schema/rename/column-rename.ts`): every way a stored body can read or
 * republish one table's column, driven through BOTH `ALTER TABLE … RENAME
 * COLUMN` and `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN`.
 *
 * The property this pins, as a property rather than as paired hand-written
 * cases: **a FROM alias adds a qualifier, it does not take the source's columns
 * out of scope.** A bare `x` written against `from t a` binds `t.x` exactly as
 * it would against `from t`, so both verbs must see it — the rename must follow
 * it, and the drop must refuse over it. Rename/drop parity falls out of the
 * same table: every spelling is asked of both verbs, and neither is allowed to
 * be blind where the other sees.
 *
 * End-to-end against a real `Database` rather than over the walker's API,
 * because the assertion is **planability** — after a rename the dependent body
 * must still run, which comparing rewritten body text cannot tell you.
 * `table-rename-scope.spec.ts` and `row-image-context-matrix.spec.ts` drive
 * their matrices over the walker directly; this one cannot.
 *
 * The `pending` cells are all one residual — a subquery source's output columns
 * would need recursive inference on its inner body, so nothing binds through
 * one — tracked by `bug-column-verbs-blind-to-star-over-subquery-source`. It
 * lands per VERB, not per spelling: a body whose inner subquery spells the
 * column is seen by the DROP guard (the inner select is walked in its own
 * frame) but not followed by RENAME (the OUTER bare ref binds through the
 * subquery source, which contributes no qualifier), so that row is pending on
 * the rename arm only. There is no matching **function source** cell: a
 * function source never carries `t`'s columns at all, so it can neither bind a
 * bare `x` nor republish one — it sits beside the subquery source in the walk
 * only because both are equally unaskable, not because it has a reachable case
 * of its own.
 *
 * Scope of the matrix: view bodies and assertion bodies. The same walk also
 * serves the expressions a *table* carries, but none of those can be authored
 * with an aliased FROM shape reaching another table, so there is nothing here
 * for them — a generated body's unqualified foreign reference is rejected at
 * declaration time (`Column 'x' referenced by generated column … not found`),
 * and a partial-index predicate rejects a subquery outright (`Unsupported
 * expression in partial-index predicate: subquery`, measured 2026-08-06), which
 * is the only way a predicate could carry a FROM clause at all. The remaining
 * site, a column DEFAULT, is pinned in
 * `test/logic/41.10.2-alter-drop-column-check-and-assertion.sqllogic`.
