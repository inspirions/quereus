/**
 * Pins the scope rules of the table-rename walk (`rename/table-rename.ts`):
 * a name the body itself binds — a CTE, a FROM alias, a subquery/function
 * source, a DML CTE target — is NOT a reference to the renamed table, while
 * genuine references under shadow-adjacent shapes still rewrite; and a bare
 * `new.` / `old.` qualifier in a written-row context (rowImageContext) is the
 * row image, not a table.
 *
 * Also pins the single-traversal invariant: `tableReferencedInAst` (the DROP
 * guard's probe) and `renameTableInAst` are two sinks over ONE walk, so for
 * every case the probe answers exactly "would a rename have rewritten this".
