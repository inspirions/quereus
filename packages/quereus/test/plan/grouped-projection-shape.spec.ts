/**
 * A grouped query builds its final projection exactly once, over the

 * aggregate function.
 *
 * Regression for bug-order-by-group-key-not-in-select-list: the branch used to
 * key off "SELECT list has an aggregate function", so a GROUP BY with no
 * aggregate ran the aggregate phase's projection *and* the non-aggregate one,
 * leaving a second Project whose column references pointed at pre-aggregate
 * attributes. A bare-column ORDER BY over a grouping key then sorted underneath
 * that stale Project and the query failed at runtime. Result-level coverage is
 * in test/logic/07.3.1-group-by-order-by-key.sqllogic; this file pins the shape
 * that regresses if the branch condition drifts back.
