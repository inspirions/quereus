 * One-sided sliding window frames — `n PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`,

 * start-only spelling `ROWS n PRECEDING` — must take the same streaming
 * one-pass plan the two-sided `n PRECEDING AND m FOLLOWING` form already takes.
 * `CURRENT ROW` is the offset-zero case of the bound it replaces.
 *
 * Two things are locked here:
 *
 *  1. **The rule really fires**, asserted off the WindowNode's `streaming`
 *     property (and its per-function mode kinds), not assumed.
 *  2. **Both physical shapes agree.** Every query runs on a normal database and
 *     on one with `monotonic-window` disabled — the streaming emitter and the
 *     buffered frame walk must return deep-equal rows, so the new recognition
 *     cannot silently change answers.
