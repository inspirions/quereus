/**

 * independent leak channels (the explicit `cteNodes` argument passed into the
 * body plan, `select-context.ts`'s fallback to `ctx.cteNodes` when that
 * argument was empty, and the shared, in-place-mutated `cteReferenceCache`).
 * `storedBodyContext` (`src/planner/stored-body-context.ts`) closes all three
