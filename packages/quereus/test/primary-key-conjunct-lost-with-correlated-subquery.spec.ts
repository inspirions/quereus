/**
 * A WHERE conjunct on the primary key must survive a re-probe of an already-committed
 * access plan.
 *
 * Regression guard for `bug-primary-key-conjunct-lost-with-correlated-subquery`. Once
 * `rule-grow-retrieve` equips a Retrieve with an index-style `moduleCtx`, that context is
 * the sole authority for what the table access enforces — `rule-select-access-path`
 * physicalizes from it and never reads `Retrieve.source`. `rule-grow-retrieve` can fire a
 * SECOND time on the same Retrieve when a later rule drops a fresh Filter on top of it,
 * and its re-probe returns a brand-new context that REPLACES the committed one. The
 * re-probe used to build its request from the incoming Filter alone, so the displaced
 * context's seek keys and residual were dropped on the floor and the query returned every
 * row. The fix unions the committed constraints into the re-probe and carries its residual
 * forward, so a context can only be replaced by one enforcing a superset.
 *
 * Three conjuncts and a CORRELATED sub-select are both required to reach it: the
 * sub-select conjunct is hoisted above the Retrieve, decorrelated into a semi join, and
 * then `join-predicate-pushdown` drops the leftover plain conjunct back down as a bare
 * Filter directly over the equipped Retrieve. With two conjuncts nothing is left over to
 * push down; with an uncorrelated sub-select the residual stays one Filter.
 *
 * Row-set coverage — including the monotonicity sweep over all conjunct subsets, the
 * BETWEEN/IN/range key shapes, and the DELETE/UPDATE arms — lives in
 * test/logic/07.7.9-conjunct-monotonicity.sqllogic. This suite pins the *plan shape*: the
 * key conjunct must still be present in the emitted program, as a seek key or as a filter
 * instruction. A row-set-only test would start passing again if a future rewrite happened
 * to reorder the conjuncts so the lost one landed somewhere harmless.
