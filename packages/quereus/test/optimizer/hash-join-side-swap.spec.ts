/**
 * The hash join's build/probe side swap must permute the preserved attributes
 * with the sides.
 *
 * `rule-join-physical-selection` builds a `BloomJoinNode(probeSource,
 * buildSource, …)` and, for an INNER join whose logical left is the smaller
 * input, swaps the two so the smaller side is the hash build side. Everything
 * else about the node already describes the row as probe-then-build:
 * `emitBloomJoin` yields `[...leftRow, ...rightRow]`, `getType()` calls
 * `buildJoinRelationType(leftType, rightType, …)` on the physical children, and
 * `computePhysical` shifts the right side's FDs by `left.getAttributes().length`.
 *
 * So the invariant asserted here is: **a physical join's advertised attribute
 * order IS its emitted row layout** —
 *
 *     join.getAttributes() === [...join.left.getAttributes(), ...join.right.getAttributes()]
 *
 * (by attribute id, in order). Before the fix a swapped node advertised
 * logical-left-then-right while emitting probe-then-build, so any consumer that
 * maps an attribute id to a column index through `getAttributes()` and then
 * indexes the row positionally read the wrong slot —
 * `emitHashAggregate`'s scan row descriptor being the one that silently returned
 * wrong aggregate values.
 *
 * Row-level correctness over the swapped join lives in
 * `test/logic/11.4-hash-join-side-swap.sqllogic`.
