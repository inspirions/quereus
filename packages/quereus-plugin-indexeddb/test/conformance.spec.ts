/**
 * Runs the shared KVStore conformance suite against the IndexedDB backend, under
 * `fake-indexeddb/auto` in Node/Mocha (same harness as every other IndexedDB spec).
 * Real-browser execution is a separate concern — see
 * tickets/blocked/feat-indexeddb-real-browser-smoke.md.
 *
 * The suite lives in `@quereus/store/testing` (built to dist — run the store build,
 * or `yarn build`, before this spec so the import resolves). The adapter opens one
 * object store within a per-test database; `reopen` drops the manager/handle WITHOUT
 * deleting the database and re-opens it, so persisted data survives — driving the

 * Both read shapes are covered: each delivered (non-null) cursor position is one entry,
 * and `getAll`'s result length is however many that request returned. Counting is the
 * only effect, so the patch is harmless to every other IndexedDB spec in this process.
 *
 * NOTE: accepted tradeoff — a process-global prototype patch, kept because there is no
 * handle to wrap and the alternative is no IndexedDB metering at all. It relies on Mocha
 * running specs serially (a parallel runner would fold another spec's reads into the
 * measured delta) and on nothing else asserting IDB read counts; revisit if either changes.
