 * and needs this table's key BYTE order to agree with it; and byte equality must be

 *
 *  - JSON → the store-local structural encoder ({@link jsonStructuralKey}): a
 *    `Uint8Array` whose memcmp order reproduces the type's structural `compare`
 *    (canonical-text bytes are identity-faithful but sort `[10]` before `[2]`,
 *    which broke overlay shadowing — see json-key.ts).
 *  - Everything else → the engine's {@link semanticKeyTransform} (the type's

 *    date as `TIMESPAN.compare`, so 'PT1H' and 'PT60M' collide on one key AND byte
 *    order is elapsed-time order.
 *
 * JSON deliberately gets NO engine `groupKey` — `groupKey` also drives GROUP BY /
 * `IN` / hash-join identity, where canonical-text identity is already correct and a
 * `Uint8Array` key would be a behaviour change for no benefit. Hence this
 * store-local seam. A semantic-ordering type with NEITHER a `groupKey` nor an entry
 * here cannot key a persisted structure soundly; `StoreTable` rejects it at DDL time
 * (see `validateSemanticKeyTransforms`).

 * This is the PHYSICAL KEY BYTES resolver — it feeds `buildIndexKey` / `buildDataKey`
 * and its output is memcmp-ordered and persisted. {@link storeDedupeKeyTransform} is

 *    member is a fixed-width NUMERIC whose memcmp order is elapsed-time order. The
 *    raw-text fallback branch of `groupKey` is unreachable for stored values.
 *  - JSON — every stored value is a `JSON_TYPE.parse` output (never a blob, never a

 *    both `deepCompareJson`'s rank order and, for cross-storage-class pairs (where

 *    a transform (`encodeCompositeKey` exempts it) and its `0x00` tag sorts below the
 *    BLOB tag the structural bytes travel under, matching NULL-first placement.
 *
 * Matched by NAME, not object identity, for the same dual-module-instance reason

 * TIMESPAN under-fetches motivate the gate:
 *
 *  - `where d > 5`: `createTypedComparator` short-circuits on the storage-class
 *    mismatch before `TIMESPAN.compare` runs, so every stored (TEXT-class) value ranks

 * THE canonical statement of how each arm degrades on `false` — the call sites point

 *
 *  - a RANGE bound is SKIPPED (`buildPKRangeBounds`, `buildIndexRangeBounds`) — dropping

 *  - a full-PK EQUALITY declines the WHOLE point arm (`analyzePKAccess`) — a point window
 *    is a single byte position, so it cannot be widened, only under-fetched.
 *  - a secondary index's EQ PREFIX stops SHORT at that column (`analyzeIndexAccess`) — a
 *    window over the columns before it is a strict superset.
 *  - an IN-list MULTI-SEEK has none of the three available (its merged windows are the

 * True when a byte window — or a byte-order advertisement — over `column` is SOUND.

 * `providesOrdering` / `monotonicOn` advertisement) equates that byte order with the order
 * `compareCollation`'s comparator defines. Two things must hold for that equation:
 *
 *  - **Same collation on both sides** (`compareCollation === keyCollation`). A `keyCollation`
 *    merely COARSER than `compareCollation` is not enough: it would need the key normalizer
 *    to be monotone with respect to the OTHER collation's order. It generally is not, even
 *    for built-ins: with `keyCollation = NOCASE` and `compareCollation = BINARY`,
 *    'K' (U+212A KELVIN SIGN) is `> 'z'` under BINARY, yet its key bytes are
 *    `toLowerCase('K') = 'k'`, which sorts BEFORE 'z' — the row falls outside a `> 'z'`
 *    window and is silently dropped.
 *  - **The normalizer preserves order** (`db._isCollationOrderPreserving`). `registerCollation`
 *    promises only that a normalizer partitions strings the way the comparator calls them
 *    equal; a custom pair may agree on equality and disagree on order.
 *
 * A never-text column is exempt: its key bytes are type-native and collation-independent.
 *
 * Returning `false` costs an optimization (the caller full-scans and lets the
 * collation-aware `matchesFilters` residual decide); returning `true` wrongly is a silent
 * wrong-result. Shared by `StoreTable`'s read arms and `StoreModule`'s access planner so the
 * "mark handled" and "build a window" decisions can never disagree.
 *
 * The PK caller ({@link pkOrderPreservingPrefixLength}) can genuinely pass two DIFFERENT
 * collations, because {@link resolvePkKeyCollations} still falls back to the table key
 * collation K for an undecorated text PK member. The secondary-index caller
 * ({@link indexLeadingRangeIsOrderSafe}) usually passes the same name on both sides — index

 *
 * `pkKeyCollations` is {@link resolvePkKeyCollations}' output for this table; an `undefined`
 * entry belongs to a never-text member, which {@link keyOrderMatchesCollation} exempts
 * outright — `tableKeyCollation` is passed only so the exempt branch has a name to ignore.
 * The comparison collation is the column's declared one, which `reconcilePkCollations` has
 * already aligned with the key collation for every *textual* PK member.
 *
 * What the advertisement is measured against is the order the planner's `Sort` would have
 * produced. For most members Sort orders under the operand's COLLATION, so a collation match
 * is the question; for a member whose logical type carries SEMANTIC ordering (TIMESPAN, JSON
 * — see docs/types.md "Semantic ordering") Sort ranks by `logicalType.compare`, and the
 * member counts only when {@link semanticKeyOrderIsFaithful} asserts the stored key bytes
 * memcmp in exactly that order (TIMESPAN's total-seconds transform, JSON's structural
 * encoding). A semantic-ordering type outside that allow-list breaks the prefix, and the
 * memory backend's typed BTree order remains the canonical order for it.
 *
 * `0` ⇒ even the leading member is unsafe: no range seek, no PK-order advertisement.
 * A prefix shorter than the PK truncates the ordering advertisement rather than voiding it.
