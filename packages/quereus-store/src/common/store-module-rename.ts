			// rewrites; reversing is a no-op wherever nothing names `newName`. The physical
			// stores have already moved by this point, so the reverse restores only the AST,
			// not the on-disk layout.
			//
			// NOTE: the reverse assumes no expression legitimately named `newName` before
			// the rename. The rename-target guard above makes that true for a real table,
			// and `compilePredicate` now rejects a foreign `table` qualifier at create time,
			// so a live partial-index predicate can only carry a self-qualifier (`where
			// <thisTable>.b > 0`) or a bare reference — never `where <newName>.b > 0` for a
			// different table. The mis-reversal path is therefore unreachable for a live
			// predicate.
			//
			// NOTE: that argument does NOT extend to the column-expression arm, and the
			// residual is left open deliberately. A DEFAULT naming a table that does not
			// exist is accepted at create time (the reference is only resolved when a row is
			// written), so `create table u (…, v integer default ((select 1 from u2)))`
			// followed by `alter table u rename to u2` has a forward pass that matches
			// nothing and a reverse pass that would clobber that `u2` back to `u`. Reaching
			// it needs `saveTableDDL` to throw, and closing it needs a per-walk changed-set
			// threaded through every arm — not worth it for a failed-persist-only path.
			//
			// NOTE: renaming a table TO the name `new` / `old` makes the reverse pass a
			// partial undo for the CHECK arm: the forward pass turns a self-qualifier
			// `t.b` into `new.b`, which the reverse walk reads as the written-row image
			// and leaves alone. Harmless today — in a CHECK on its own table the two
			// spellings denote the same row — so this is a spelling residual, not a
			// semantic one. Revisit if a CHECK ever gains a legal bare qualifier naming a
			// table OTHER than its own; then the reverse pass needs the same per-walk
			// changed-set the residual above wants.
			// NOTE: a third residual, same class and same accepted rationale as the two
			// above. The reverse pass reuses the FORWARD snapshot with the NEW name's
			// key, relying on the resolver's miss→home fallback to key a bare `newName`
			// under this schema — which holds only while no OTHER schema on this
			// schema's home path already has a table or view called `newName`. When one
			// does, the bare name resolves there instead, the reverse walk matches
			// nothing, and a rewritten self-reference stays spelled `newName` after the
			// rollback. Closing it wants the same per-walk changed-set the residual
			// above wants; unreached without a failed persist.
			//
			// Planner-parity resolution, snapshotted here — this hook runs before the
			// engine's catalog swap, so the snapshot sees the pre-rename catalog.
			// `tableRenameTargetsFor` pairs it with the post-rename sibling, which is
			// what the rewrite's post-condition asks (a rewritten reference must still
			// resolve to the renamed table). Deriving it — rather than passing the
			// pre-rename resolver twice — is load-bearing whenever the session
			// `schema_path` reaches past this schema: with `main,temp` and a
			// `temp.<newName>` present, the pre-rename snapshot answers `temp.<newName>`
			// for the rewritten bare name and the walk would schema-qualify a
			// self-reference the engine's own pass leaves bare, diverging the persisted
			// DDL from the in-memory catalog. The reverse (rollback) direction gets its
