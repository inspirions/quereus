/**
 * Build the set of physical store names this module's data/index stores
 * currently occupy in `schemaName`, mapping each name to a human description
 * of the logical object that owns it (for sited collision messages).
 *
 * Physical store names are built by string concatenation (`{schema}.{table}` /
 * `{schema}.{table}_idx_{index}`) and the `_idx_` delimiter is itself a legal
 * substring of any identifier, so two distinct logical objects (e.g. index
 * `archive` on `t` and a sibling table `t_idx_archive`) can collapse to the
 * same physical name. This set is the authoritative occupancy used by
 * {@link StoreModuleBase.assertStoreNameFree} to reject such a collision at CREATE time.
 *
 * The occupancy is the union of two sources, robust to lazy connection and the
 * isolation wrapper (see the ticket's "Enumeration source" section):
 *   1. `tables` — every store table the owning module touched this session.
 *   2. the target schema's catalog tables whose `vtabModule === owner` and which
 *      are not views — store-backed tables not yet lazily connected.
 * Names embed the schema prefix, so cross-schema entries never collide and no
 * per-schema filter on `tables` is needed. Memory-backed siblings and
 * views own no store in this provider and are excluded (the `=== owner` /
 * `!isView` filter) to avoid false-positive rejects.
 *
 * No self-exclusion: at each guarded call the candidate object is not yet
 * registered (create/createIndex run before the engine adds it) so it cannot
 * self-collide; and for renameTable the renamed table's OWN stores stay in the
 * set deliberately. Any overlap between a name the rename introduces and an
 * own current store is a footprint-swap rename (`t` with index `x` → `t_idx_x`,
 * or table `u_idx_x` with index `x` → `u`) that providers cannot relocate
 * safely — relocation order determines whether a source is clobbered before it
 * is moved — while no benign rename produces such an overlap. Keeping own
 * stores in the set therefore causes no false rejects and keeps the
 * reject-before-any-side-effect guarantee uniform.
 *
 * `owner` is the module instance whose stores these are — the concrete `StoreModule` at
 * the top of the layer chain, which this base layer cannot name without an import cycle.
 * It is a parameter (rather than `this`) purely so the identity check keeps a real type
 * instead of needing a cast; the enumeration itself reads no other module state.

	 *   insert can itself be the duplicate) throws with the enclosing transaction
	 *   already flushed. The store stays unmutated — only the transaction is gone.
	 *   Validation that can read effectively belongs before the call, so the
	 *   transaction survives it — the SET COLLATE PK re-key does exactly that
	 *   (`StoreTable.validateRekeyedPrimaryKey` reads the effective rows, pending
	 *   ops included, before this flush; `rekeyRows` pass 1 is only its backstop).
	 *
	 * Subsequent `commit()` calls on the same coordinator are no-ops
	 * (`inTransaction` is cleared), which keeps the enclosing transaction safe.
	 * The savepoint stack is cleared too, so a later `ROLLBACK TO` / `RELEASE` that
