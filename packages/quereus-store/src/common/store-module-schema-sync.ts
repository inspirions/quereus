	 *   1. **Tables** — `importCatalog` (connect to existing storage; refresh connected

	 *   2. **Views** — `importCatalog` (engine silent-register; body validation deferred
	 *      to query time, so order among views — and view-over-MV / view-over-view —
	 *      does not matter, and no schema-change event fires → phase 2 writes nothing).
	 *   3. **Materialized views** — `importCatalog` per entry (engine re-materialize:
	 *      rebuilds the memory backing from current source data, re-registers row-time
	 *      maintenance, re-runs the eligibility gate — the same core the create emitter
	 *      uses, but silent: no `materialized_view_added` fires, so phase 3 writes
	 *      nothing back to the catalog). A store-hosted backing that phase 1 already
	 *      rehydrated is **adopted without the refill** when the engine's adopt gates
	 *      pass — see the clean-shutdown marker below.
	 *
	 * **Clean-shutdown marker.** Before anything loads, the reserved
	 * `\x00meta\x00clean_shutdown` catalog entry (written by `StoreModule.closeAll` after
	 * every batch flushed) is consumed: parsed into `{ trusted, staleAtClose }`, then
	 * **deleted immediately** — single-use, so a crash later in this session (or a
	 * second rehydrate without an intervening clean close) is detected at the next open
	 * and every adopt falls back to the always-correct drop+refill, self-healing any
	 * crash-window divergence (coordinated commit is not 2PC across stores). The marker
	 * payload is the JSON set of MVs that were **stale-at-close** (row-time maintenance
	 * detached, so the durable backing may be behind); phase 3 withholds trust per-entry
	 * for those — `trustBackings: trusted && !staleAtClose.has(name)` — so a
	 * stale-at-close MV refills (recomputing content and re-arming maintenance) while
	 * every live-at-close MV keeps the fast path. The one shared `adoptedBackings` set
	 * composes across fixpoint rounds (an upstream MV adopted in round 1 enables its
	 * dependent in round 2, while a refilled — or stale-at-close — upstream is never
	 * added to it, forcing dependents to refill).
	 *
	 * **MV-over-MV ordering** is handled by a fixpoint retry rather than a static topo
	 * sort: an MV's resolved `sourceTables` are computed at import time, not serialized
	 * in the DDL, so they are unavailable before import. Each round passes the names of
	 * every OTHER still-pending MV entry as `pendingDerivations`; the engine defers any
	 * entry whose body reads one (its source already pre-exists as a phase-1 plain
	 * table, so the body would otherwise plan against content the upstream's own import
	 * may be about to replace). The loop repeats while any MV makes progress — robust to
	 * arbitrary nesting depth. A genuinely unbuildable MV — a missing (e.g. memory)
	 * source, or an unresolvable cycle — makes no progress in a round and is recorded in
	 * `errors`.
	 *
	 * Per-entry errors in any phase are collected (not fatal) so one bad object does not
	 * abort the rest.
	 *
	 * Call after `db.registerModule()` (and `db.setDefaultVtabName()` if DDL may lack a
	 * USING clause).

	 * - **It self-filters on ownership.** Every table the engine registers is announced,
	 *   including memory tables and other modules'. `ownsTableCatalogEntry` is the test for
	 *   "would this module write that table's entry" (and already handles the isolation
	 *   wrapper, whose `vtabModule` is the wrapper exposing us as `underlying`). The
	 *   view/MV arms need no such filter — views and MVs are not owned by a module.
	 * - **It compare-writes rather than blind-puts.** `table_added` is re-delivered during
	 *   rehydration for a store-hosted materialized-view backing
	 *   (`SchemaManager.createBackingTable`), where the entry phase 1 already wrote is
	 *   current; comparing keeps that a no-op so a second consecutive reopen still yields
