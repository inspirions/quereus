 * its stores share one atomic commit domain. All stores passed to `put`/`delete`
 * must have been produced by the same provider.
 *
 * Stores are addressed by {@link KVStore} handle (matching how the transaction
 * coordinator already tracks each op's target store), not by name — so it
 * composes with the coordinator's per-store bucketing without a name lookup.
 *
 * Same-key ordering matches {@link WriteBatch}: queued ops apply in queue order,
 * so for one (store, key) pair the later op wins. The coordinator replays its
 * pending ops into one atomic batch without collapsing duplicates, so a
 * transaction that writes then deletes the same row depends on this.
 *
 * SINGLE USE: a batch is spent once `write()` resolves — queue one commit's ops, write
 * once, drop it (what the coordinator does). Reuse after `write()` is deliberately
 * unspecified and backends differ: LevelDB's chained batch is closed by `write()` and
 * throws on any later call, while IndexedDB's merely resets its op list and keeps working.
 *
 * NOTE: there is also no dispose — a batch that is built and then abandoned without
 * `write()` (only reachable today if queueing throws MISUSE, i.e. a programming error)
 * leaks whatever the backend holds until GC. If an abandoned-batch path ever becomes

	 * holds. An implementation may buffer a FIXED-SIZE batch — IndexedDB pages 256
	 * entries at a time, `abstract-level` hands back one entry per `next()` — but it
	 * must never read the whole range before yielding the first entry. Reason: a full
	 * table scan calls `iterate(buildFullScanBounds())` with NO limit, and the mobile
	 * backends that run this code have the least memory headroom of any of them.
	 *
	 * A backend whose dataset is already wholly resident in memory by construction
	 * (`InMemoryKVStore`) satisfies this trivially — the requirement bounds reads from
	 * BACKING STORAGE, and such a backend has none.
	 *
	 * EARLY TERMINATION IS CHEAP. A consumer that stops after k entries must cost
	 * roughly k entries of work, not the size of the range: `limit: 10` over a million
	 * rows must not read a million rows. Concretely, reads from backing storage must
	 * stay within `k + (one batch)`, whatever the implementation's batch size is.
	 *
	 * TOTAL WORK IS LINEAR. Draining the whole range must read about one entry per
	 * entry. A paged backend resumes from the LAST KEY SEEN — never by re-reading from
	 * the start and discarding a growing prefix. `limit`/`offset` paging is O(n²) reads
	 * yet still looks fine to a peak-memory check, so this is stated separately.
	 *
	 * EARLY TERMINATION RELEASES RESOURCES. When the consumer `break`s or throws, the
	 * returned iterable's `return()`/`throw()` runs; the implementation must close its
	 * cursor / transaction / statement there — a `try/finally` around the yield loop —
	 * not only on natural exhaustion. After an abandoned iteration the store must still
	 * serve `get`/`iterate` normally and `close()` must still resolve.
	 *
	 * NO SNAPSHOT PROMISE. Batching splits one logical read into several physical ones,
	 * so a write committed mid-scan may become visible partway through a scan where a
	 * single-shot read could not have shown it. `iterate` therefore does NOT promise a
	 * point-in-time view and consumers must not assume one. This is honest about what
	 * the stack already does: `StoreTable`'s scan merges the transaction coordinator's
	 * pending ops over the committed range, and the store stack declares
	 * `readCommittedSnapshot: false`. A real snapshot read is separate, future work.
	 *
	 * Backends without a streaming cursor (a SQL `select` hands back a whole result set)
	 * should page with {@link pagedIterate} rather than re-deriving the resume edge.
	 * `runKVStoreConformance`'s bounded-iteration tier enforces all of the above for any
	 * backend whose adapter supplies a read meter.
