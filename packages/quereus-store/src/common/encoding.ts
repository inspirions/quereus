/**
 * Key encoding utilities for persistent storage.
 *
 * Encodes SQL values into byte arrays that preserve sort order when compared
 * lexicographically. Supports composite keys and collation-aware encoding.
 *
 * Type prefixes ensure correct cross-type ordering:
 *   0x00 - NULL (sorts first)
 *   0x01 - NUMERIC (bigint + number unified; orders by value across int/real)
 *   0x03 - TEXT (UTF-8, null-terminated, NOCASE by default)
 *   0x04 - BLOB (raw bytes, escaped + null-terminated)
 *
 * Collation support:
 *   A TEXT/OBJECT value's key bytes are produced by running the value through the
 *   collation's KEY NORMALIZER — the `(s: string) => string` whose output equality
 *   partitions strings exactly as the collation's comparator does. Normalizers are
 *   resolved through `EncodeOptions.normalizers`, which callers holding a `Database`
 *   must set to `db.getKeyNormalizerResolver()` so key bytes and value comparisons
 *   agree on which strings are the same value.
 *
 * Unpaired surrogates:
 *   A TEXT value holding an unpaired surrogate (a half of a surrogate pair with no
 *   matching other half) is REJECTED here rather than encoded — see
 *   {@link findUnpairedSurrogate}. It is a legal JS string and a legal in-memory
 *   Quereus text value, but it is not valid Unicode and no UTF-8 byte sequence encodes
 *   it, so it has no faithful key bytes. This is the one deliberate behavioural
 *   divergence between a memory table (accepts the value) and a store-backed table
 *   (raises at encode time). The alternative — `TextEncoder`'s silent fold to U+FFFD —
 *   maps all 2048 lone surrogates onto one key, merging distinct rows.
