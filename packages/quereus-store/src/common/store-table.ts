/**
 * Generic KVStore-backed Virtual Table implementation.
 *
 * This is a platform-agnostic table implementation that works with any
 * KVStore implementation (LevelDB, IndexedDB, or custom stores).
 *
 * Storage architecture:
 *   - Data store: {schema}.{table} - row data keyed by encoded PK
 *   - Index stores: {schema}.{table}_idx_{name} - one per secondary index
 *   - Stats store: __stats__ - unified store for all table statistics, keyed by {schema}.{table}
 *
 * The class is layered across four files, each adding one job to the one below:
 *   `store-table-base.ts`        - state, store handles, stats, transaction lifecycle
 *   `store-table-scan.ts`        - the read path (predicate -> byte window -> rows)
 *   `store-table-constraints.ts` - secondary-index maintenance + UNIQUE enforcement
 *   `store-table.ts`             - this file: the write path and bulk row maintenance

	/**
	 * The store's counterpart of the memory backend's
	 * `MemoryTableManager.validateRekeyedPrimaryKey`: the two throw-only questions a
	 * PK re-key must answer, over two DIFFERENT row sets, BEFORE anything is flushed
	 * or mutated (see docs/memory-table.md §"A collation change on a PRIMARY KEY
	 * column obeys a stricter rule"):
	 *
	 *  1. **Is the change legal?** — over `effectiveRows`, the rows the DDL-issuing
	 *     transaction can SEE (a wrapper's `EffectiveRowSource` when the isolation
	 *     layer holds the transaction's staged rows outside this store, else this
	 *     table's own effective stream). Two rows on one new key here is a duplicate
	 *     a `select` in this transaction would return, so the change is invalid →
	 *     `CONSTRAINT`, naming the colliding key.
	 *  2. **Can the store carry it?** — over this store's COMMITTED rows, the set a
	 *     `rollback` must be able to restore. The data store holds one row per key,
	 *     so a committed pair collapsing onto one new key cannot be represented even
	 *     when the transaction has deleted one of them → `BUSY`, with the memory
	 *     module's "commit/rollback and retry" posture.
	 *
	 * Probe order is what makes the statuses right, with no backend sniffing: the
	 * committed probe can only fire once the effective one passed, i.e. only when the
	 * committed rows are NOT a subset of the effective ones — which happens exactly
	 * when the transaction has DELETED a committed row (staged in a wrapper's overlay,
	 * or buffered in this module's own coordinator). A collision among rows the
	 * transaction can still see therefore always reports `CONSTRAINT`, never `BUSY`.
	 *
	 * The buffered-delete case makes the bare module stricter than it used to be: the
	 * old post-flush pass committed the delete first and then re-keyed happily, quietly
	 * spending the transaction's rollback. It now refuses with the same `BUSY` the
	 * wrapped path gives, and `commit; <retry>` still lands the change.
	 *
	 * Both probes key through {@link rekeyedKeyComputer}, so they and the re-key agree
	 * byte-for-byte.
	 *
	 * NOTE: these two probes put both re-keying arms — SET COLLATE on a PK member and
	 * ALTER PRIMARY KEY — at four full table scans (two here, then {@link rekeyRows}'
	 * pass 1 backstop and pass 2), each holding one hex
	 * key signature per row. Fine for a statement this rare; if a huge table ever makes
	 * it slow, drop pass 1 for callers that pre-validated — it cannot fire for them.

	 * collisions — two distinct old keys collapsing to one new key under a coarser
	 * collation or a narrower PK. On collision we throw `CONSTRAINT` without touching
	 * the store. For `ALTER PRIMARY KEY` this pass is the gate; for `ALTER COLUMN …
	 * SET COLLATE` on a PK member it is only a backstop — that arm has already run
	 * {@link validateRekeyedPrimaryKey}'s two probes before the DDL flush, so a
	 * refusal there leaves the enclosing transaction alive. The second pass RE-SCANS
	 * the same committed store, recomputes each
	 * new key, and batches deletes of displaced old keys + puts of new (key, row)
	 * pairs into ONE atomic batch. Rows whose new key matches the old key are no-ops.
	 *
	 * Holding signatures instead of whole rows halves peak memory: the prior design
	 * retained the entire table in a map AND again in the batch. The re-scan trades
	 * O(rows) CPU (a second iterate + newKey recompute) for not buffering the table
	 * twice. Pass 1 and pass 2 iterate the SAME bounds over the SAME committed store
	 * and see identical rows: nothing writes between them — we are single-threaded
	 * within the ALTER, outside the coordinator, and every caller ran
	 * `StoreModule.ddlCommitPendingOps` first so "committed" is "everything live".
	 *
	 * The final single `batch.write()` is the ONLY thing making the re-key
	 * all-or-nothing — do not chunk-flush it. Its residual peak (the batch still holds
	 * every changed row) is irreducible without breaking atomicity; tracked separately
	 * in `debt-store-atomic-batch-bounded-memory`.
	 *
	 * Only the data store is rewritten — secondary indexes are rebuilt by the
	 * caller (the keys embed the PK suffix, so they must be rebuilt whenever
	 * the PK changes).
	 *
	 * The new key for each row is encoded under `newColumns`'s per-column PK
	 * collations, so this drives BOTH:
	 *   - `ALTER PRIMARY KEY` — the PK *columns* change; `newColumns` defaults to the
	 *     current column set (their collations are unchanged), and
	 *   - `ALTER COLUMN … SET COLLATE` on a PK member — the PK columns stay the same
	 *     but one column's collation changes; the caller passes the post-ALTER
	 *     `updatedSchema.columns` so the new key bytes follow the new collation.
	 * The OLD key is taken verbatim from the stored entry (never re-encoded), so the
	 * old collation is implicit in the existing bytes and need not be supplied.

	/**
	 * Apply externally-originated row ops directly to this source table's
	 * COMMITTED storage: table-owned data-key put/delete, secondary-index
	 * maintenance, and stats tracking. The index-maintaining counterpart of
	 * `StoreBackingHost.applyMaintenance` (which targets index-less MV backings),
	 * built for trusted replication-style writes.
	 *
	 * Deliberately:
	 *   - emits NO module {@link DataChangeEvent}s — the external writer owns
	 *     emission and the `remote` flag;
	 *   - opens NO coordinator transaction — writes land in committed state
	 *     immediately (`store.put`/`store.delete`, never the coordinator);
	 *   - runs NO constraint validation (PK/UNIQUE/CHECK/FK) — the origin is
	 *     trusted, mirroring the backing-host posture.
	 *
	 * Returns the EFFECTIVE per-op {@link BackingRowChange}s with accurate
	 * before-images (the shape `Database.ingestExternalRowChanges` consumes),
	 * suppressing no-ops to match the normative upsert-suppression contract in
	 * `vtab/backing-host.ts`: a delete of an absent key, and a value-identical
	 * upsert (`rowsValueIdentical` — byte-faithful, collation-UNAWARE, against the
	 * effective existing row) write nothing and report nothing. A collation-equal /
	 * byte-different upsert (e.g. a case-only rewrite under a NOCASE PK) keeps the
	 * SAME data key (key identity is collation-aware) but IS a real update that
	 * replaces the stored bytes and reports `update`.
	 *
	 * Last-writer-wins against any concurrently pending local transaction on this
	 * table: the external write commits to storage at once, and that transaction's
	 * pending batch may overwrite these keys when it commits. This is the same
	 * posture the prior raw-KV sync adapter took — not a regression, now stated.
