 * - `sha256` on a source that is not an `https:` URL (`npm:`, a bare package

 *
 * Every entry is checked, and every problem is reported together: fixing one
 * typo only to be stopped by the next one, a run at a time, is worse than seeing

 *
 * The pins that *did* validate are seeded even when others failed. The caller
